name: Main
description: Semantic main content area. Used to wrap the primary content of the application.
importPath: grommet
framework: react
props:
- name: background
  type: string
  required: false
  description: Background color token (use 'background-back' for main areas)
- name: pad
  type: string | object
  required: false
  description: Padding inside the main area
- name: fill
  type: boolean | 'horizontal' | 'vertical'
  required: false
  description: Whether to fill available space
- name: overflow
  type: '''auto'' | ''hidden'' | ''scroll'' | { horizontal: string, vertical: string
    }'
  required: false
  description: Controls scrolling behaviour. Use overflow='auto' in app-shell patterns
    so the main area scrolls independently of the fixed header and sidebar.
- name: id
  type: string
  required: false
  description: 'DOM id for the element. Required when pairing with SkipLinks: set
    id=''main-content'' on Main so the SkipLink with the matching id can focus and
    scroll to it.'
usage:
  whenToUse:
  - Use Main for the primary content area of an app layout.
  - Use background='background-back' for proper visual hierarchy.
  - Place inside Grid when building app shell layouts.
  - Use round prop on top corners for polished app shell look.
  whenToAvoid:
  - Do not use Box as='main' — use Main component.
  - Do not use more than one Main per page.
  - Do not nest Main inside Main.
examples:
- description: Main in App Shell
  code: "<Main\n  gridArea=\"main\"\n  background=\"background-back\"\n  round={{\
    \ corner: 'top-left', size: 'small' }}\n  pad=\"medium\"\n>\n  <Page>\n    <PageContent>\n\
    \      {/* Page content here */}\n    </PageContent>\n  </Page>\n</Main>"
- description: App Shell with SkipLinks (accessibility best practice)
  code: "// Place SkipLinks as the very first child of the root Grommet/Box\n<SkipLinks>\n\
    \  <SkipLink id=\"main-content\" label=\"Skip to main content\" />\n</SkipLinks>\n\
    <Header>...</Header>\n<Main id=\"main-content\" gridArea=\"main\" background=\"\
    background-back\" overflow=\"auto\">\n  {/* page content */}\n</Main>"
variants:
- name: default
  description: Standalone main content wrapper with no visual decoration.
  when: Simple page layouts where Main wraps all page content and is not part of an
    app shell grid.
  example: <Main background="background-back" pad="medium">{/* page content */}</Main>
- name: app-shell
  description: Main used as a named grid area in an app shell layout. Typically styled
    with a rounded top-left corner to complement a fixed sidebar.
  when: Application shell patterns with a fixed Header and sidebar Nav where the main
    area scrolls independently.
  example: '<Main gridArea="main" background="background-back" round={{ corner: ''top-left'',
    size: ''small'' }} fill>{/* content */}</Main>'
anatomy:
- label: main landmark
  region: root
  purpose: HTML <main> semantic landmark containing the page's primary content; used
    by assistive technology for skip-navigation
  availability: always
behaviors:
  realEstate:
  - fill
  - responsive
accessibility:
  aria:
  - attribute: role
    value: main
    condition: Implicit — Main renders as the HTML <main> element, which carries the
      landmark role 'main' automatically.
  - attribute: aria-label
    value: descriptive label
    condition: Only needed when multiple main landmarks exist on the page to differentiate
      them for screen reader users (rare).
  wcag:
  - criterion: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
    status: pass
  - criterion: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value
    status: pass
    note: Main renders as the HTML <main> element, which intrinsically carries the
      ARIA landmark role 'main'. No explicit role or aria-* attribute is required
      unless there are multiple main landmarks on the same page.
  - criterion: 2.4.3 Focus Order
    status: conditional
    note: When SkipLinks targets Main via the id prop, ensure the element (or its
      first interactive child) can receive programmatic focus. Add tabIndex={-1} on
      Main if focus is not captured after skip-link activation.
  - criterion: 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks
    status: conditional
    note: The <main> landmark alone is not sufficient — keyboard users must also have
      a mechanism to skip past the Header and Nav. Add a SkipLinks + SkipLink pair
      before the Header, pointing at the Main element's id prop. Without this pairing,
      keyboard users must Tab through every navigation item on every page load.
