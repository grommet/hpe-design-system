usage:
  whenToUse:
  - Use toast notifications for low-priority, non-action-oriented updates that don't
    require immediate attention.
  - Use inline notifications near the content they relate to when context matters.
  - Use global banner notifications for system-wide conditions that affect all users.
  - 'Match status to severity: info for tips, warning for potential issues, critical
    for failures.'
  whenToAvoid:
  - Do not use notifications for errors that should be displayed inline in a form
    — use FormField error instead.
  - Do not stack multiple toast notifications simultaneously; queue them.
  - Do not use critical status for informational messages — reserve it for urgent
    failures.
  - Avoid placing interactive content inside a notification that auto-closes.
variants:
- name: toast
  description: Floating overlay notification that appears transiently and may auto-dismiss.
  when: Low-priority status updates that do not require user action, such as a successful
    save or background sync completion.
  example: "<Notification\n  toast\n  title=\"Changes saved\"\n  message=\"Your configuration\
    \ has been saved successfully.\"\n  status=\"normal\"\n  onClose={() => setVisible(false)}\n\
    />"
- name: inline
  description: Embedded notification rendered in the page flow near related content.
  when: Contextual warnings or errors tied to a specific section of the UI, such as
    a form section or data panel.
  example: "<Notification\n  title=\"Validation failed\"\n  message=\"One or more\
    \ fields contain errors. Please review and correct them.\"\n  status=\"critical\"\
    \n  actions={[{ label: 'Review errors', onClick: scrollToErrors }]}\n/>"
- name: global-banner
  description: Full-width banner pinned to the top of the viewport for system-wide
    alerts.
  when: System-generated alerts that affect all users, such as maintenance windows,
    outages, or security advisories.
  example: "<Notification\n  global\n  title=\"Scheduled maintenance\"\n  message=\"\
    The system will be unavailable from 2:00–4:00 AM UTC.\"\n  status=\"warning\"\n\
    />"
- name: with-actions
  description: Notification with one or more call-to-action links or buttons embedded
    in the message.
  when: When the notification requires the user to take a specific next step, such
    as reviewing a log or acknowledging an alert.

    \ SSL certificate expires in 7 days.\"\n  status=\"warning\"\n  actions={[\n \
    \   { label: 'Renew certificate', onClick: handleRenew },\n    { label: 'Remind\
