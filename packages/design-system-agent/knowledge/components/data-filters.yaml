usage:
  whenToUse:
  - Use inside a Data component context.
  - Use layer prop for complex multi-filter UIs.

  - Provide DataFilter children for specific property filters.
  whenToAvoid:
  - Do not use outside a Data component.
  - Avoid too many visible filters — use layer for 4+ filters.
examples:

  code: "<DataFilters>\n  <DataFilter property=\"status\" />\n  <DataFilter property=\"\
    role\" />\n</DataFilters>"
- description: Filters in Layer
  code: <DataFilters layer />
variants:
- name: layer
  description: All filter controls open in a Layer overlay when the filter button
    is clicked.
  when: Four or more filter properties, or complex filter controls that need ample
    space. Keeps the Toolbar compact.
  example: <DataFilters layer />
- name: drop
  description: Filter controls open in a Drop (popover) anchored to the filter button.
  when: Two to three filters where a popover is less intrusive than a full Layer overlay.
  example: <DataFilters drop />
- name: inline
  description: Filter controls are always visible inline, with no trigger button.
  when: One or two simple filters where persistent visibility is preferable to hiding
    them behind a button.
  example: <DataFilters><DataFilter property="status" /></DataFilters>
