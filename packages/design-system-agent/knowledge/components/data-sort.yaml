usage:
  whenToUse:
  - Use inside a Data component context.
  - Place in Toolbar alongside DataSearch and DataFilters.
  - Use drop prop for compact sort UI.
  whenToAvoid:
  - Do not use outside a Data component.
  - Do not duplicate sort behavior with DataTable sortable prop.
examples:
- description: Sort Control
  code: "<Toolbar>\n  <DataSearch />\n  <DataSort />\n  <DataFilters />\n</Toolbar>"
- description: Sort by specific property
  code: <DataSort property='name' />
variants:
- name: drop
  description: A compact button that opens a drop with sortable property options and
    direction selector.
  when: Toolbar usage alongside DataSearch and DataFilters where horizontal space
    is limited.

- name: inline

    toggle.
  when: When sort is a primary interaction and hiding it behind a button would reduce
    discoverability.

    selector shown.
  when: When only one column needs sorting.
