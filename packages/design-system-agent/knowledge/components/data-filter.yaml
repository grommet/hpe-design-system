description: Individual filter control for a specific data property. Renders appropriate
  filter input based on data type.
importPath: grommet
framework: react
props:
- name: property
  type: string
  required: true
  description: The data property name to filter on
- name: children
  type: React.ReactNode
  required: false
  description: Custom filter control (e.g., CheckBoxGroup, RangeInput)
- name: options
  type: 'string[] | { label: string, value: string }[]'
  required: false
  description: Explicit list of filter options to offer. When provided, DataFilter
    renders a Select or CheckBoxGroup with these options instead of auto-deriving
    them from the data. Use when the data set is large or when you want to offer values
    not present in the current data.
- name: multiple
  type: boolean
  required: false
  description: Allows the user to select more than one filter value simultaneously.
    Results include rows matching any of the selected values (OR logic).
- name: badge
  type: boolean
  required: false
  description: When true, a numeric badge is shown on the parent DataFilters button
    indicating how many active filter values are selected for this property. Helps
    users understand the current filter state at a glance.
usage:
  whenToUse:
  - Use inside DataFilters component.
  - Let it auto-generate filter UI when possible.
  - Use children prop for custom filter controls.
  whenToAvoid:
  - Do not use outside DataFilters or Data context.
  - Do not manage filter state manually.
examples:
- description: Auto-generated Filter
  code: <DataFilter property="status" />
- description: Custom Filter Control
  code: "<DataFilter property=\"category\">\n  <CheckBoxGroup options={['A', 'B',\
    \ 'C']} />\n</DataFilter>"
variants:
- name: auto-generated
  description: DataFilter renders appropriate filter UI automatically based on the
    data type of the property (CheckBox for booleans, Select for string options configured
    in Data.properties).
  when: The default for most use cases. Configure filter options in the parent Data
    component's properties prop rather than customising the filter control.
  example: <DataFilter property="status" />
- name: custom
  description: User provides a custom filter control as children, replacing the auto-generated
    UI.
  when: Specialised filter controls — date range pickers, numeric range sliders, or
    multi-select with search — that cannot be expressed through the auto-generated
    options.
  example: <DataFilter property="category"><CheckBoxGroup options={['A', 'B', 'C']}
    /></DataFilter>

accessibility:
  keyboard:
  - key: Tab / Shift+Tab
    action: Moves focus into and out of the filter control
  - key: Space / Enter
    action: Opens a Select dropdown or toggles a CheckBox option
  - key: Arrow Down / Arrow Up
    action: Navigates options inside an open Select dropdown
  - key: Escape
    action: Closes an open Select dropdown without applying a value
  aria:
  - attribute: label association
    value: property label from Data.properties config
    condition: The filter label displayed above the control is derived from the Data
      component's properties configuration. Always provide a label in properties to
      ensure screen readers can announce the filter purpose.

    note: When using the children prop with a custom control (e.g. a plain CheckBoxGroup
      or RangeInput), ensure the control has an accessible label. The auto-generated
      filter label above the control is not automatically associated via htmlFor/aria-labelledby
      with a custom child. Pass a label prop directly on the child control or use
      aria-labelledby pointing to the filter label element.
