Human sensitivity to technology, as understood through research and a relentless pursuit of community engagement, allow the Design System to be inclusive, conversational, and adaptable.

## Inclusive

Meeting WCAG accessibility standards, creating responsive experiences, and adhering to readability guidelines are just the beginning of understanding what it means to be inclusive. Community discussions that allow the Design System to thrive invites new ideas, innovation, and ongoing learning. The Design System seeks to embrace an ethic that honors human engagement in the digital experience, keeping in mind emotional and social implications of the experience.

## Attentive

Being human-centered requires attention to the needs of others. We first listen to our customers, with curiosity while seeking understanding. Listening attentively is an act of humility and it is a part of our ethos that buildst the community. Being attentive is followed by action through thoughtful presentation of data, utilizing a task-based approach to craft experiences, and ensuring services and application core competencies.

## Conversational

The HPE Design System elicits a conversation in two ways. It first enables people to craft experiences that engage in an interactive dialogue. The Design System allows for the design to express tone and give voice to an interaction. Each interaction elicits a positive or negative response that compiles into an entire experience for the user. Second, the Design System elicits conversation to continue its evolution, growth, maturity, and adaptability. It will not meet every need and solve every solution. However, it can bring about a conversation to safely allow people to be bold and accelerate what's next.
