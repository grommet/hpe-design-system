### HPE green

HPE green, referred to as `brand` <ColorSwatch background="brand" /> in Design System resources,
and all other colors are provided by the HPE theme and Figma. [Visit Color](/foundation/color) to
learn about color palettes and their use within HPE applications.

### MetricHPE font

HPE fonts are provided by the HPE theme and Figma. [Visit typography](/foundation/typography) for

### Call to action button

Call to action buttons provide an opportunity to make the HPE Element a distinctive and
recognizable feature associated with key value delivered by HPEâ€™s edge-to-cloud promise.

CTA buttons are not a replacement for primary action buttons. They have a distinct
purpose and styling. For details on when to use one versus the other, read the
[CTA vs. primary action buttons](/components/button#when-to-use-a-cta-button).

  <CallToActionButton />
</Example>

## Flexible ingredients

### Color and texture styles

Gradient, datawave, and light/shadow assets can be consumed directly from the HPE theme.

These assets may be seen commonly throughout marketing contexts and should be used more
sparingly within platform. However, there are appropriate use cases such as or a page header
for a service catalog or [call to action cards](/components/card/call-to-action-card), where
the incorporation of bolder, vibrant elements communicate "unlocking value" and can inspire
and entice the user.

See [HPE theme backgrounds](https://github.com/grommet/grommet-theme-hpe/blob/master/src/js/themes/backgrounds.js)
for a full list of background values.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/site/src/examples/foundation/distinctive-brand-assets/ColorAndTexture.js"
  horizontalLayout
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
>
  <ColorAndTexture />
</Example>

### Typography styles

Texture or gradient in type can easily be implemented using [Box](/components/box)'s `background`
plus [Heading](/components/heading) or [Text](/components/text).

For rules such as "only place texture or gradient filled text on white backgrounds" and other
advice, please refer to [HPE Brand Central](https://brandcentral.hpe.com/brand-central/content/distinctive-brand-assets).

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/site/src/examples/foundation/distinctive-brand-assets/TypographyStyles.js"
  horizontalLayout
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
>
  <TypographyStyles />
</Example>
