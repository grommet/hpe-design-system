There are two categories of typography design tokens: heading and text. Each are offered in a range of t-shirt sizes. At each t-shirt size, there is a defined font-size, font-weight, and line-height.

The values of each typography value were chosen to ensure readability as well as alignment with the broader [spacing system](/design-tokens/layout-and-spacing#foundational-scale).

Always use all parts of a typography t-shirt size together; do not mix and match tokens of different t-shirt sizes on a single text element.

## Heading

Heading design tokens should be used on HTML heading elements (h1-h6). Heading tokens are offered in 6 sizes: "xlarge"-"xxsmall".

Generally, an h1 should be styled with the "xlarge" token, an h2 with "large", and so on.
