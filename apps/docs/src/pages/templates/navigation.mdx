Navigation is the overall structure providing users screen direction to complete a task logically and easily through a website or an application.

Part of creating a seamless application or interface is creating an obvious flow from one view or interaction to the next. Think of navigation as a story map where you help guide your user through each process.

## Types of navigation

Pages and content of a site or service are typically organized in an information hierarchy. Navigation provides various means for traversing this hierarchy depending on the user's task.
There are 5 navigational directions in which a user can maneuver:

**Drill Down** - Used when the user wants to view greater detail on the current topic than the current page displays.

**Side-to-Side** - Used to visit to the next or previous sibling of the current page, typically when the user is scanning across similar items.

**Reverse Navigation** - Used to return to the previous visited page using the browser's built-in back button.

**Matrix** - Used to "jump" to a different place in the information hierarchy which isn't a direct parent or child of the current page.

**Ascending Navigation** - Used to allow the user to move up the information hierarchy from a child page to its parent.

## What makes navigation successful

Users should always be able to tell where they are on a page, application or product and should be predictable as to how they can get to the next step or destination. A task has a start and an end point so it is important to keep the functionality or task(s) in mind when creating products with common user experiences and expectations.
