### Latest Releases

  - Implement grid layouts, such as a [dashboard of cards](/templates/dashboards#two-column-dashboard), which gracefully adapt and flow.

If so, the additional breakpoints are breaking changes from v2 and may require minor code changes to ensure backwards compatibility. A [migration guide](https://github.com/grommet/grommet-theme-hpe/wiki/Migrating-from-HPE-Theme-2.x-to-3.x) is available to make this a smooth process.

## March 9, 2022 - April 1, 2022

### Communications

- To help scale and accelerate Design System feature delivery, we are actively working on a process for receiving design contributions from members outside of the Design System core team.

Stay tuned!

### Roadmap Updates

- **Page Layouts**
  - Updated the [Page Layouts Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/4rdBkUlHd5MCVq3hvUOXHd/Page-Layouts?node-id=2891%3A21273) to reflect new Page component in Grommet. Page component guidance and examples coming soon to the Design System site.

- **Tabs**
  - Began working with stakeholders to understand uses cases and standardize scenarios with more than 5 Tabs across HPE applications. The scope of this work is to define how to visually display tabs across different resolutions.

This change has been made in the Figma component and is available in the grommet-hpe-theme v2.4.0.
