T-shirt sizes (design tokens) define component dimensions through the `size`
property. Common options include `small`, `medium`, and `large`, with extended 
ranges like `xxsmall` or `3xlarge` available for certain components. All 
components share a common dimension lineage based on 
[element design tokens](/design-tokens/element), ensuring standardized sizing 
for core UI building blocks and consistent alignment across layouts.

Examples supporting t-shirt sizes include:

- Typography - [Heading](/foundation/typography#heading), [Paragraph](/foundation/typography#paragraph), [Text](/foundation/typography#text)
- Controls - [Anchor](/components/anchor), [Button](/components/button), [Pagination](/components/pagination)
- Visualizations - [Avatar](/components/avatar), [Spinner](/components/spinner), [Tag](/components/tag)

## Default sizes

Components exposing a `size` property default to `medium` when unspecified.

In the button example below, “Default” and size=”medium” produce the equivalent rendering:

```jsx
<Button label="Default" primary />
<Button label="Medium" primary size="medium" />
```

Omit the `size` property when `medium` is appropriate. Omission reduces verbosity 
without altering appearance.
