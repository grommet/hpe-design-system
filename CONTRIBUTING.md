### Pre Commits
Linting and end-to-end tests are run using husky.

#### aries-site
- There are pre-commit hooks in place that will run linting checks and
fixes. It will then run the test suites that we have in place for Aries-Site.
- [TestCafe](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/getting-started/) is used as our end-to-end testing. While running the tests, your local browsers will open with TestCafe. During this time DO NOT CLOSE OR MINIMIZE YOUR BROWSER WINDOWS. The browser will need to stay in focus in order
to run and complete all of the test suites.
- The [tests will pause](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1198) if they are not in focus which will lead to pre-commits taking much longer than needed. If your pre-commit checks are taking longer than 2.5 minutes, it is likely that your browser is not in focus. Put your browser in focus to allow the checks to continue.
After the pre-commit checks are finished on aries-site, they will be run on aries-core.

#### aries-core
- The pre-commit checks will run linting checks for aries-core.

### Completed Pre-Commits
Once all of the pre-commit checks are passed, you can add your commit message and push up a PR to be reviewed.
