import { Box, Image } from 'grommet';

In this tutorial you will:

- Leverage various Box properties to build a hero section for a page.

At the end of this tutorial, you will have built this:

<Box width="large">
  <Image src="/learnImages/box-model-part-one/box-model-final.png" />
</Box>

## Prerequisites

This tutorial can be completed by following the steps below but introductory knowledge of [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) will help ensure the details of the syntax and concepts make sense.

## Getting started

Let’s get started. Use this [CodeSandbox template](https://codesandbox.io/s/hpe-design-system-tutorial-starter-be7kse?file=/src/App.js) as a starter.

First, add the Box to your project by importing it from Grommet and add some placeholder text like “Hello world.”

```
import { Box, Grommet } from 'grommet';
import { hpe } from 'grommet-theme-hpe';
...
return (
    <Grommet theme={hpe} full="min">
	    <Box>Hello world</Box>
    </Grommet>
)
```

## Add hero section content

Now, you'll add the content within the Box. Start by importing Button, Heading, Image, and Text.

```
import { Box, Button, Heading, Image, Text } from 'grommet';
```

Delete the placeholder “Hello world” and add in the following content as children of the Box.

To learn more about the properties applied to these components, check out the API docs for [Heading](https://v2.grommet.io/heading), [Text](https://v2.grommet.io/text), and [Button](https://v2.grommet.io/button).

```
...
<Box>
  <Heading margin="none">
    New HPE ProLiant Servers Engineered for your Hybrid World
  </Heading>
  <Text size="xlarge">
    With a cloud operating experience, built-in security, and optimized
    performance for your workloads to drive your business forward.
  </Text>
  <Button label="Learn more" kind="cta-primary" />
  <Image src="https://www.insight.com/content/insight-web/en_US/shop/partner/hewlett-packard-enterprise/product-portfolio/servers/jcr%3Acontent/top-inner-full-width/column_layout/-column-1/image_0.img.jpg/1566699651505.jpg" />
</Box>
...
```

At this point, your project should look something like this:

<Box width="large">
  <Image src="/learnImages/box-model-part-one/step-1.png" />
</Box>

## Use direction to affect content layout

Now, we’d like to adjust the layout direction of the content in the Box. To do so, apply `direction="row"` to the Box. By default, the layout direction of Box is “column”.

```
...
<Box direction="row">
  <Heading margin="none">
...
```

Notice how all the content is displayed in a row because each element was a direct child of the Box we added `direction` property to. However, we would like the heading, text, and button to be grouped and displayed in a column. To do so, wrap these elements in a Box of their own.

```
<Box direction="row">
  <Box>
    <Heading margin="none">
      New HPE ProLiant Servers Engineered for your Hybrid World
    </Heading>
    <Text size="xlarge">
      With a cloud operating experience, built-in security, and optimized
      performance for your workloads to drive your business forward.
    </Text>
    <Button label="Learn more" kind="cta-primary" />
  </Box>
  <Image src="https://www.insight.com/content/insight-web/en_US/shop/partner/hewlett-packard-enterprise/product-portfolio/servers/jcr%3Acontent/top-inner-full-width/column_layout/-column-1/image_0.img.jpg/1566699651505.jpg" />
</Box>
```

Now, the image and the Box containing the heading, text, and button are the only two direct children of the container Box, so only those elements are displayed in a row. For any content that we wanted to display in a column, we had to group it in its own Box.

At this point, your project should look like this:

<Box width="large">
  <Image src="/learnImages/box-model-part-one/step-2.png" />
</Box>

## Use Box to manage an image's width

Right now, the dimensions of the image file are determining how wide it is. In order to have more control of the image’s width, wrap the image in its own Box.

```
...
<Box>
  <Image src="https://www.insight.com/content/insight-web/en_US/shop/partner/hewlett-packard-enterprise/product-portfolio/servers/jcr%3Acontent/top-inner-full-width/column_layout/-column-1/image_0.img.jpg/1566699651505.jpg" />
</Box>
...
```

## Adjust width to manage content dimensions

In order to ensure the text content remains a more readable width across wide screens, apply `width="large"` on the Box containing the heading, text, and button. To keep the button from stretching the full width of the box, apply `alignSelf="start"` on the Button. Notice how the button is no longer spanning the entire width of the Box.

```
<Box direction="row">
  <Box width="large">
    <Heading margin="none">
      New HPE ProLiant Servers Engineered for your Hybrid World
    </Heading>
    <Text size="xlarge">
      With a cloud operating experience, built-in security, and optimized
      performance for your workloads to drive your business forward.
    </Text>
    <Button alignSelf="start" label="Learn more" kind="cta-primary" />
  </Box>
  <Box>
    <Image src="https://www.insight.com/content/insight-web/en_US/shop/partner/hewlett-packard-enterprise/product-portfolio/servers/jcr%3Acontent/top-inner-full-width/column_layout/-column-1/image_0.img.jpg/1566699651505.jpg" />
  </Box>
</Box>
```

Note: Throughout this tutorial, we’ll be using t-shirt sizes. Make sure to read the [explanation on t-shirt sizes](/foundation/tshirt-sizing) for more information on what they are and their value in Grommet.

At this point, your project should look something like this:

<Box width="large">
  <Image src="/learnImages/box-model-part-one/step-3.png" />
</Box>

## Add a background color and pad

Now, let’s add a background color to the hero section by adding `background="background-contrast"` to the outer Box. We also want some space added between the edge of the outer Box and the content. To do so, add `pad="large"` to the outer Box.

Remember that `pad` (equivalent to CSS padding) applies space _inside_ of a given container while `margin` applies space **\*\*\***outside**\*\*\*** of a given container.

```
<Box direction="row" background="background-contrast" pad="large">
  <Box width="large">
    <Heading margin="none">
      New HPE ProLiant Servers Engineered for your Hybrid World
    </Heading>
    <Text size="xlarge">
      With a cloud operating experience, built-in security, and optimized
      performance for your workloads to drive your business forward.
    </Text>
    <Button alignSelf="start" label="Learn more" kind="cta-primary" />
  </Box>
  <Box>
    <Image src="https://www.insight.com/content/insight-web/en_US/shop/partner/hewlett-packard-enterprise/product-portfolio/servers/jcr%3Acontent/top-inner-full-width/column_layout/-column-1/image_0.img.jpg/1566699651505.jpg" />
  </Box>
</Box>
```

At this point, your project should look something like this. We’re getting closer, but we’re missing the space between the various content elements.

<Box width="large">
  <Image src="/learnImages/box-model-part-one/step-3.png" />
</Box>

## Use gap to add space between elements

Now, let’s add the spacing between elements. Whenever space is needed between elements, use `gap` on the parent Box of those elements. To add space between the image and the grouped content, add `gap="large"` to the outer Box.

```
<Box direction="row" background="background-contrast" pad="large">
  <Box width="large">
    <Heading margin="none">
      New HPE ProLiant Servers Engineered for your Hybrid World
    </Heading>
    <Text size="xlarge">
      With a cloud operating experience, built-in security, and optimized
      performance for your workloads to drive your business forward.
    </Text>
    <Button alignSelf="start" label="Learn more" kind="cta-primary" />
  </Box>
  <Box>
    <Image src="https://www.insight.com/content/insight-web/en_US/shop/partner/hewlett-packard-enterprise/product-portfolio/servers/jcr%3Acontent/top-inner-full-width/column_layout/-column-1/image_0.img.jpg/1566699651505.jpg" />
  </Box>
</Box>
```

Notice how the gap only applies between the image and the heading/text/button group but not between the heading, text, and button. That’s because `gap` will only apply space between the direct children of a Box. In this case, the direct children were:

1. The Box containing the Heading, Text, and Button.
2. The Box containing the Image.

Now, add space between the heading, text, and button by applying `gap="medium"` to the Box that wraps those elements.

```
...
<Box width="large" gap="medium">
    <Heading margin="none">
        New HPE ProLiant Servers Engineered for your Hybrid World
    </Heading>
    <Text size="xlarge">
        With a cloud operating experience, built-in security, and optimized
        performance for your workloads to drive your business forward.
    </Text>
    <Button alignSelf="start" label="Learn more" kind="cta-primary" />
</Box>
...
```

Great job! You have built a hero section of a page using Box and its various properties. Your project should look like this:

<Box width="large" margin={{ bottom: 'medium' }}>
  <Image src="/learnImages/box-model-part-one/box-model-final.png" />
</Box>
