In this tutorial you will use Grid to display a collection of products, similar to
that of an e-commerce website, and use its [properties](https://v2.grommet.io/grid?theme=hpe#props)
to:

- Present a collection of items in a grid.
- Allow the number of grid columns to adapt to a variety of screen widths.
- Allow the items to adapt and flex within the available space.

At the end of this tutorial, you will have built this:

## Prerequisites

This tutorial can be completed in its entirety by following the steps below. However,
because Grommet is a ReactJS-based UI library, introductory knowledge of
[React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) may be helpful in understanding
the syntax.

## Getting started

Let’s get started. Use this [CodeSandbox template]() as a starter.

First, in `App.js` add the Grid to your project by importing it from Grommet and
placing it around the “hello world” text.

```js
import { Grommet, Box, Text, Grid } from 'grommet';
import { hpe } from 'grommet-theme-hpe';
...
return (
  <Grommet theme={hpe}>
    <Grid>
      hello world
    </Grid>
  </Grommet>
);
```

## Add placeholder content

Now that you have the Grid in place, let's add some placeholder content. Replace the
"hello world" text with the following:

```js
<Grid>
  <Box background="blue" border pad="medium" align="center">
    <Text size="large">Product 1</Text>
  </Box>
  <Box background="blue" border pad="medium" align="center">
    <Text size="large">Product 2</Text>
  </Box>
  <Box background="blue" border pad="medium" align="center">
    <Text size="large">Product 3</Text>
  </Box>
  <Box background="blue" border pad="medium" align="center">
    <Text size="large">Product 4</Text>
  </Box>
  <Box background="blue" border pad="medium" align="center">
    <Text size="large">Product 5</Text>
  </Box>
  <Box background="blue" border pad="medium" align="center">
    <Text size="large">Product 6</Text>
  </Box>
  <Box background="blue" border pad="medium" align="center">
    <Text size="large">Product 7</Text>
  </Box>
</Grid>
```

We now have a Grid with six boxes, each containing a product name. The Grid is
displaying the boxes in a single column, which is the default behavior.

## Add columns

To display the boxes in a grid, we need to add columns. The Grid component has a
`columns` property that allows you to specify the number and/or width of the
columns you want to display. Let's add the `columns` property to the Grid and set
it to `1/3`.

```js
<Grid columns="1/3">...</Grid>
```

Now the boxes are displayed in a grid with three columns.

## Add product content

Now that we have a grid with three columns, let's add some product content to the
boxes. Replace the placeholder content with the following:

```js

```
