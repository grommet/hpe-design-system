In this tutorial you will use Grid to display a collection of products, similar to
that of an e-commerce website, and use its [properties](https://v2.grommet.io/grid?theme=hpe#props)
to:

- Present a collection of items in a grid.
- Allow the number of grid columns to adapt to a variety of screen widths.
- Allow the items to adapt and flex within the available space.

At the end of this tutorial, you will have built the [final layout](#step-6-final-layout) in Step 6 below.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial can be completed in its entirety by following the steps below. However,
because Grommet is a ReactJS-based UI library, introductory knowledge of
[React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) may be helpful in understanding
the syntax.

## Step 0: Getting started

Let’s get started. Use this [CodeSandbox template](https://codesandbox.io/s/grid-fundamentals-part-one-starter-ljmks2?file=/src/App.js) as a starter.

First, in `App.js` add the Grid to your project by importing it from Grommet and
placing it around the “hello world” text.

```js
// App.js
import { Grommet, Box, Heading, Text, ThemeContext, Grid } from 'grommet';
import { hpe } from 'grommet-theme-hpe';
...
return (
  <Grid>
    <Text>hello world</Text>
  </Grid>
);
```

<br />

Let's also add a heading to the page.

```js
<>
  <Heading level={1}>Products</Heading>
  <Grid>
    <Text>hello world</Text>
  </Grid>
</>
```

## Step 1: Add placeholder content

Now that you have the Grid in place, let's add some placeholder content. Replace the
"hello world" text with the following:

```js
<Grid>
  <Box background="blue!" border pad="medium" align="center">
    <Text size="large">Product 1</Text>
  </Box>
  <Box background="blue!" border pad="medium" align="center">
    <Text size="large">Product 2</Text>
  </Box>
  <Box background="blue!" border pad="medium" align="center">
    <Text size="large">Product 3</Text>
  </Box>
  <Box background="blue!" border pad="medium" align="center">
    <Text size="large">Product 4</Text>
  </Box>
  <Box background="blue!" border pad="medium" align="center">
    <Text size="large">Product 5</Text>
  </Box>
  <Box background="blue!" border pad="medium" align="center">
    <Text size="large">Product 6</Text>
  </Box>
  <Box background="blue!" border pad="medium" align="center">
    <Text size="large">Product 7</Text>
  </Box>
</Grid>
```

We now have a Grid with seven boxes, each containing a product name. The Grid is
displaying the boxes in a single column, which is the default behavior.

## Step 2: Add columns

To display the boxes in a grid, we need to add columns. The Grid component has a
`columns` property that allows you to specify the number and/or width of the
columns you want to display. Let's add the `columns` property to the Grid and set
it to `{ count: 3, size: 'auto' }`.

```js
<Grid columns={{ count: 3, size: 'auto' }}>...</Grid>
```

Now the boxes are displayed in a grid with three columns.

<GridStepOne />

## Step 3: Add product content

Now that we have a grid with three columns, let's add some product content to the
boxes. Start by adding `ProductCard` and `productList` to App.js. `ProductCard` is
a template set up for ease of use and will be used to display the product image, name,
and price. `productList` is a JSON file containing the product data.

<Notification
  message={
    <Paragraph fill margin="none">
      To learn more about the components used in ProductCard, check out the API
      docs for{' '}
      <Anchor
        href="https://v2.grommet.io/card"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        label="Card"
      />
      , <Anchor
        href="https://v2.grommet.io/box"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        label="Box"
      />, <Anchor
        href="https://v2.grommet.io/button"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        label="Button"
      />, <Anchor
        href="https://v2.grommet.io/heading"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        label="Heading"
      />, <Anchor
        href="https://v2.grommet.io/paragraph"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        label="Paragraph"
      />, and <Anchor
        href="https://v2.grommet.io/text"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        label="Text"
      />.
    </Paragraph>
  }
  width="xlarge"
  margin={{ bottom: 'medium' }}
  status="learn"
/>

```js
// App.js
import { Grommet, Box, Heading, Text, ThemeContext, Grid } from 'grommet';
import { hpe } from 'grommet-theme-hpe';
import { ProductCard } from './ProductCard';
import productList from './product-list.json';
...
```

<br />

Then, replace the placeholder content with the following:

```js
<Grid columns={{ count: 3, size: 'auto' }}>
  {productList.map(product => (
    <ProductCard
      key={product.id}
      name={product.name}
      price={product.price}
      image={product.image}
    />
  ))}
</Grid>
```

Now the products are displayed in the grid with three columns.

<StepTwo />

## Step 4: Responsive columns

Take a moment to resize the browser window. Adjust the width, both wider and narrower. Notice
that the products appear squished when the browser window is narrow and stretched when the
browser window is wide. This is because the Grid is not responsive. Let's fix that.

To make the Grid responsive, we will adjust the `columns` property. Set the `columns` property
to `"medium"`.

```js
<Grid columns="medium">...</Grid>
```

Now the Grid will fit as many columns as will fit in the available space, with each column
being a minimum width of the t-shirt size 'medium'.

<Notification
  message={
    <Paragraph fill margin="none">
      Did you know that Grommet uses "t-shirt sizes" to make implementing
      consistent layouts easy? Learn more about{' '}
      <Anchor href="/foundation/tshirt-sizing" label="t-shirt sizing" />.
    </Paragraph>
  }
  width="xlarge"
  margin={{ bottom: 'medium' }}
  status="learn"
/>

Notice how the number of columns changes as the browser window is resized. The Grid is now
responsive.

<StepThree />

## Step 5: Polishing the layout

Now that we have a responsive Grid, let's polish the layout. Let's add some space
between the products by adding `gap="xsmall"` to the Grid.

```js
<Grid columns="medium" gap="xsmall">
  ...
</Grid>
```

<StepFour />

<br />

Finally, let's refine the column width to be a bit more efficient with our screen's
real-estate. A minimum column width of `"medium"` feels too wide. Let's try setting
the `columns` property to `"xsmall"`.

```js
<Grid columns="xsmall" gap="xsmall">
  ...
</Grid>
```

Now we are able to display more products in each row, but they become too narrow.
Let's make our final modifications by importing the function `midSize` from a
utilities file, add two additional lines of code which calculate a column width between
'small' and 'medium', and then use that value in the `columns` property.

```js
...
import productList from './product-list.json';
import { midSize } from './utils';

const ProductsPage = () => {
  const themeContext = React.useContext(ThemeContext);
  const minColumnWidth = midSize('small', 'medium', themeContext);
  ...
  <Grid columns={minColumnWidth} gap="xsmall">
    ...
  </Grid>
```

## Step 6: Final layout

Congratulations! You have completed the tutorial and have a great start on a very
respectable product catalog.

<StepFive />

## Summary

In this tutorial, you learned how to:

- Use the Grid component to present a collection of items in a grid.
- Use the `columns` property to specify the number and/or width of the columns.
- Use the `columns.count` property to specify the number of columns.
- Use the `colums.size` property to specify the width of the columns.
- Use the `columns` property to respond to the space available.
- Use the `gap` property to add space between the items.
