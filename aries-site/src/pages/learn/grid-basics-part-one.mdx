In this tutorial you will use Grid to display a collection of products, similar to
that of an e-commerce website, and use its [properties](https://v2.grommet.io/grid?theme=hpe#props)
to:

- Present a collection of items in a grid.
- Allow the number of grid columns to adapt to a variety of screen widths.
- Allow the items to adapt and flex within the available space.

At the end of this tutorial, you will have built this:

<!-- show example of product cards in a grid -->

## Prerequisites

This tutorial can be completed in its entirety by following the steps below. However,
because Grommet is a ReactJS-based UI library, introductory knowledge of
[React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) may be helpful in understanding
the syntax.

## Getting started

Let’s get started. Use this [CodeSandbox template]() as a starter.

First, in `App.js` add the Grid to your project by importing it from Grommet and
placing it around the “hello world” text.
