## Guidance

Forms provide a way to collect important data from a user. However, this data is only collected effectively when Forms are built in a way in which users are inclined to fill out in full.

### Usage

Forms don't need to be a tedious task for users to complete, as they often come to be. It is important to ease as much of this effort as possible when building a Form. Making Forms simple to complete leads to increase in form completion.

**Follow these guidelines when creating a Form:**

- Use as few fields as possible
- Wrap all input elements within a FormField
- Fill in default values for as many fields as possible
- Reveal fields progressively so the user is not overwhelmed
- Use clear, concise labels for each field
- Use placeholder text as an added visual indication of expected input value format

### Required vs. optional fields

- When possible, restrict forms only to fields that are required in order to keep them concise.
- There may be cases where optional fields may be appropriate. In these forms, clearly denote which fields are optional vs. required. This way, users won't be forced to infer anything - but can instead stay focused on completing their task.
- Limit the number of optional fields as much as possible. Remember that the more fields you have on your form, the more you risk overwhelming the users.

<ExampleImagePreview
  label="Required and Optional Fields Example"
  src="/required&optional-Fields-example.png"
  href="/forms#required-and-optional-fields"
  alt="HPE Design System Form example where required and optional fields are used."
/>

**Forms where 'asterisk' and 'optional' can be skipped**

A login/registration form, which typically shows two to three required fields do not need to be annotated in any way - the form is short and the necessity of completing the fields is relatively obvious.

For login/registration forms, apply `required={{ indicator: false }}` to the FormFields to remove the required indicator.

<ExampleImagePreview
  label="Forms where 'asterisk' and 'optional' can be skipped"
  src="/form-example-nonrequired.png"
  href="/forms#sign-in"
  alt="HPE Design System Form where required and optional can be skipped"
/>

### Using help text

In most cases, the FormField label should be clear enough to instruct the user how to complete a field. However, if help text is required, ensure that it is kept brief and precise.

Help text may be relevant for cases such as [password requirements](#sign-up) or [additional resources](#customize) on a field's context.

### Capitalization in forms

Writing standards contribute to the voice, tone, and grammatical accuracy that inform the experiences we create. These standards are aligned with HPE Brand.

Within a form, you should:

- Use title case and capitalize short prepositions when they are the last word in a sentence (e.g. Sign Up, Sign Out)
- For headings and captions, use sentence case

### Button placement and labeling

Submit, reset, or cancel buttons should always be placed at the bottom of a Form.

Button labels should be specific to the action of the button. For example, a [sign-up form](#sign-up) may have a submit button with label "Sign Up". Alternately, a [password change form](#change-password) may have a button with label "Update Password".

Button label specificity provides users confidence in the action they are performing.

### User-Entered Input

There should be few restrictions on user-entered input.

- Resource naming should allow for spaces, punctional characters, unicode characters.
    - Examples: Björk Guðmundsdóttir, 联想, John Q. Public, etc.
- User-entered input needs to be encoded to prevent [SQL injection](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp) and [XSS attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).

### Form submission

Visual feedback is important to instill confidence in a user after form submission.

**On submission, your form should:**

- In the case of an error, focus should be placed on the input element where the error occurred.
- Provide user with indication that form was submitted successfully (e.g. notification, success page, etc.)
- Display all relevant errors accompanied by text explaining actions needed to resolve.
- Allow user to continue navigating through the application immediately

Never force the user to wait for post-submission processing to complete before they can continue using an application.

### Accessibility

All Form input elements need to be contained within a FormField.

**FormFields need to have:**

- A "for" property that matches the id of its child input. If using Grommet, this is applied with the htmlFor prop.
- A "name" property applied on both the FormField and its child input element
- A clear, concise label
