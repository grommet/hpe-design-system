## Guidelines

Table customization is important for larger, more complex tables with many columns.
Users can choose which columns to show in the table as well as the order in which they appear.

## What makes up the customizable table?

### An action to display column visibility and order controls.

Place a button with an `Edit` icon next to the `Actions` menu for the table on the
right side above the table. The `Actions` menu is mainly for actions which modify
items in the table. Controls like the search and filter controls change what items
are shown in the table or how they are presented rather than changing the items
themselves. Since we want to customize the table itself, we have a separate controls
for changing which columns are shown in the table and their order.

### Column visibility

Clicking on the `Edit` button opens a new drop down which has two tabs. The first tab 
includes checkboxes for each column. By checking or unchecking the checkboxes you can
make columns appear or disappear from the table.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/table-customization/components/ColumnSettings.js"
  horizontalLayout
  height="none"
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
>
  <ColumnSettingsExample />
</Example>

### Column order

The second tab on the drop down contains the list of columns which allows ordering
the columns by dragging the column names in the list or by using the move up and
move down buttons to change the column order in the list. This will also change the
order of the columns in the table.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/table-customization/components/ColumnSettings.js"
  horizontalLayout
  height="none"
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
>
  <ColumnSettingsExample activeIndex={1} />
