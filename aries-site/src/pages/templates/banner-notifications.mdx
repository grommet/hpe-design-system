## Guidelines

Global Banners are high-attention notifications used primarily for status updates on background processes and upcoming system changes and releases.

Global Banners are used to showcase Warning and Critical statuses. They are also a mechanism for informational alerts. Depending on the severity of the information, they may remain persistent across multiple sessions or be dismissable by the user.

## Anatomy
<Example

>
  <BannerNotificationDiagram />
</Example>

1. Status Indicator is an icon made of a shape and color to capture the user’s attention
2. Message is a short description explaining the issue
3. Anchors (optional)  are used to direct users to links related to the notification
4. Close Button (optional) is used to dismiss the notification

## Best Practices 
### Placement
- Always located directly below the Global Header without a gap and should not obscure any underlying content or action
- Can persist across multiple sessions until dismissed if necessary

### Format
- Only show one banner at a time
- Global Banners should stay within the 192 character limit
- Long text is not truncated but instead will wrap on smaller screen sizes
- Anchors are left-aligned and will wrap alongisde the text
- Use only two or fewer anchors
- Utilize writing guide to stay within character count as well as the writing effective content guidance for appropriate language

### Behavior
- Never sticky and should scroll when there is other content
- The background spans the full width of the screen, but the content resizes alongside the Global Header


## When should you use Global Banners?
Since Global Banners take over the top of an interface and can be intrusive, they should be reserved only for important system generated updates. Also when applicable, Global Banners should always have a relevant anchor(s) to direct users to further actions or to view more about the issue in full detail.

### Informational:
- new feature 
- new release coming

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/banner-notification/Examples/BannerNotificationInfo.js"
  github="https://github.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/tree/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/banner-notification/Examples/BannerNotificationInfo.js"

  height={{ min: 'small' }}

  <BannerNotificationInfo />
</Example>

### Critical:
- scheduled maintenances
- unavailable access to the platform due to the system

### Warning:
- subscriptions about to expire
- session timeout

  height={{ min: 'small' }}
  caption="An example of a Global Banner that is not dismissable but provides an anchor for the user to solve the issue."

  <BannerNotificationWarning />
</Example>

### Do not use Global Banners for:
Completion of tasks, such as long running or batch actions
Success or failure confirmations
Low-attention and low-severity information

For low-severity notifications that do not require user action or user attention such as confirmation receipts, instead use Toast Notifications.

## Things to Avoid
- Do not use use close icon when information is important and needs to remain persistent. Also consider whether or not the information should remain persistent across multiple sessions
- Global Banners are not clickable, instead use anchors to direct users to take further action or to view the issue in full detail
- Overly long notifications can take up lots of screen real estate on smaller screens
