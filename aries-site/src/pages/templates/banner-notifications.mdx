Banner Notifications are comprised of the following elements:

1. [**Status Indicator**](n/templates/status-indicator) an icon made of a shape, color and content to capture the user’s attention
2. **Message** is a short description explaining the issue
3. **Close Button** (optional) is used to dismiss the notification

## When to use

Consider using Banner Notifications in the following use cases:

- Scheduled maintenance within the system or platform
- Subscription expiration
- Feature releases

## When not to use

Don’t use Banner Notifications in the following use cases:

- Device component failures
- Task related alerts
- To show if task is successful. Instead, use [Toast Notifications](/templates/toast-notifications).

## Guidelines

### Format

- Place below global header.
- Show one banner at a time.
- Implement inline with the page content to ensure no other content is obscured.
- Limit to 192 characters to avoid truncation. Content will be restricted to a single line. If there is insufficient width for the whole message, it will be truncated.

### Things to Avoid

- Do not allow dismissal of the banner (`onClose`) when information is critical (such as potential access loss).
- Do not stack banners on top of one another; use a single banner at a time.

### Behavior

- Never sticky, should scroll when there is other content
- When clicked, should direct user to notification center when clicked.
- When dismissed, should remove the banner from the screen but the notification will still exist in the notification center.

### Placement

- Banner notifications should always be located directly below the Global Header, above the Page Header.
- All Banner notification widths should align to the page content. For more information, visit [Page Layouts](/templates/page-layouts).

Used to warn the user about:

- Unavailable access to the platform due to the system
- Scheduled maintenances (good for persistent)
