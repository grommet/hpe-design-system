# Banner Notifications

Banner Notifications are alerts that attract users attention about system conditions, updates and may be dismissed by the user. 

Banner Notifications are comprised of the following elements:
1. [**Status Indicator**](https://design-system.hpe.design/templates/status-indicator?q=statu) an icon made of a shape, color and content to capture the user’s attention
2. **Message** is a short description explaining the issue
3. **Close Button** (optional) is used to dismiss the notification

## When to use
Consider using Banner Notifications in the following use cases:

- Scheduled maintenance within the system or platform
- Subscription expiration
- Feature releases



## When not to use
Don’t use Banner Notifications in the following use cases:

- Device component failures
- Task related alerts
- To show if task is successful. Instead, use [Toast Notifications](https://design-system.hpe.design/templates/toast-notifications?q=toas)


## Guidelines:
### Format
- Place below global header
- Show one banner at a time
- Implemented inline with the page content to ensure no other content is obscured
- Keep within the 192 character limit to avoid truncation
- Utilize guide to stay within character count

### Things to Avoid
- Do not use use close icon when information is important and needs to remain persistent
- Do not stack banners on top of one another
 
### Behavior
