## Guidance

Hub &amp; Spoke Navigation works well for applications primarily concerned with task execution, as opposed to presenting large volumes of content.

The "hub" cleanly presents multiple discreet application sections or "spokes." Each "spoke" keeps the user focused on the task at hand and used independently from other spokes.

A hub should consist of no more than five to seven spokes &mdash; if more paths are needed, subsequent hubs are always an option. Each step down provides navigational context back up the information hierarchy. Each page has a primary focus with minimal contextual navigation chrome.

### When to Use Hub &amp; Spoke

Hub &amp; Spoke should be used when:

- Users desire focus on a single application or task at a time.
- Presenting an overview of the applications, tasks, or content available, with the ability to drill in for detail.
- In cases where a user's device is limited in screen real estate.
