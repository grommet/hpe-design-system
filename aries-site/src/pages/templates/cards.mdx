Elements of a card can include titles, subheadings, charts, media, metadata, and notifications. They are flexible and customizable to organize your content.

## What makes up a Card?

### Form

- Aligns to the grid and global edge size for gap, margin, and pad
- Shape and direction may be horizontal or vertical
- Can include a footer for additional information
- Customizable background, border, and elevation

### Purpose

- Allows the user to quickly scan and determine if they should engage further
- Focused and concise information of a single subject
- Primarily limited to a singular action (like a large button)
- Secondary actions (i.e. clickable icons, anchors, buttons) should be clearly distiguishable. When applying these use cases, the card no longer should behave as a primary action.

## How might a Card be used?

### Content

- Provides the user a preview of information to scan and process
- Visually group content or distinguish various types of information
- Easily organize content in grid or list layouts

### Layout

- Summarizes information to easily visualize and compare
- Creates a uniform, homogenous collection of content
- Organize in a responsive grid or list (i.e. dashboard or navigation)
- Displays items in a data set that can best be identified visually

### Dashboard Example

Cards can be customized to meet the needs of the content. In a dashboard, content is organized and displayed for the user to quickly scan and make decisions about further engagement. Each card is customizable and clickable (like a large button) to explore details of the summarized content.
Learn more about [Dashboard Templates](/templates/dashboards).

### Navigation Example

A grid of cards can provide a simple set of easy to navigate items. In this example, the cards are a uniform, homogenous collection of services that can be easily scanned. Each card is clickable to enter or explore the service.
Learn about the [Grid Component](/components/grid).

## Any additional guidelines for Card?

### General

- Limit content to under 100 characters or no more than two short sentences
- Provide a visual hierchy to content
- Only one idea or subject in one card
- Differentiate the card from its background using color, border, shadow, or contrast

### Actions

- The card typically behaves as a singular action item (like a big button)
- Secondary actions should be differentiated visually and behaviorally
- Do not include inline links/anchors.

### Grid, List, or Table?

- Grid is great for dashboards or when the use case for the cards lend themselves to larger sizes and simple scanning (i.e. service catalog)
- A list of cards is great when you need to display more cards that have simple content but have serveral items (a list of users).
- Consider using list alone, without the card component, when actions required for items are more complex (like multi-select)
  -When content needs to be analyzed, sorted, compared and filtered, a table may be more appropriate.

## More Examples of a Card

### Simple Card

Consider a small, simple card for smaller data sets that can be scanned easily in a list.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-design/design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/cards/SimpleCard.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/card?theme=hpe#props"
>
  <SimpleCard />
</Example>

### Card with a Footer

Adding footer content can help provide additional information that can provide more context, clarity, or display notification data.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-design/design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/cards/CardWithFooter.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/card?theme=hpe#props"
  background="background-back"
>
  <CardWithFooter />
</Example>

### Card with an Image

When images are featured on cards, they have a full ‘bleed’ as well as heirachical text to give additional context for the content.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-design/design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/cards/CardWithImage.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/card?theme=hpe#props"
>
  <CardWithImage />
