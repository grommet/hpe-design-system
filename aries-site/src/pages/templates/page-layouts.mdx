## Elements of an App UI
The User Interface (UI) for an HPE application consists of three 
building blocks: App Container, Global Header and Footer, and 
Page Container.

<Example
  caption='Diagram of the "building blocks" composing an application 
    user interface: an App Container which contains the Global Header & Footer, and 
    a Page Container.'
  pad="none"
  previewWidth="min-content"
>
  <AppAnatomy />
</Example>

1. **App Container**
- The container serves as the outer shell of a page UI.
- This is the parent component containing all HTML elements within a grid.
- Its responsibility is to organize each of the page components, how they 
relate to eachother, the spacing between each, and how they respond at 
various screen widths.

2. **Global Header & Footer**  
- The Global Header, also known as the [HPE Common Header and Footer 
Web Service](/templates/global-header), provides a tunable, yet consistent 
header and footer to be used across all HPE applications.
- No matter the screen size, the Global Header & Footer will always be full 
width, occupying as much space as available.

3. **Page Container**  
- The Page Container contains the Page Content and the Page Header.
- It is responsible for the layout for the main content of a page. 
- Page container width may be [Wide](#wide-default), [Narrow](#narrow), of [Full](#full).

<Box direction="row" align="center" gap="xsmall">
  <Clock />
  <Text weight="bold" size="large">Coming soon:</Text>
</Box>

## Page Container
The Page Container is responsible for the layout for the main content of a page.
It contains the Page Header and its Page Content.

<Example
  caption='Diagram of a Page Container which contains a Page Header 
    and the Page Content.'
  pad="none"
  previewWidth="min-content"
>
  <PageAnatomy />
</Example>

### Page Container Widths
There are 3 page container widths from which to choose, depending on 
the layout use case: [Wide](#wide-default), [Narrow](#narrow) and [Full](#full). 

In all cases, the minimum width of content is `336px`, after which horizontal 
scrolling is enabled.

#### Wide (default)
- This is the default width for the Page Container. 
- Using the "wide" content width scales the Page Container until a maximum width of `1608px`. 
- If the screen is larger than `1608px`, the Page Container will be center aligned and white space 
will be displayed around the perimeter of the content. 

<Example
  caption='Diagram displaying how a "wide" Page Container scales horizontally relative to 
    the App Container. The App Container fills the viewport while the "wide" 
    Page Container reaches a maximum width.'
  pad="none"
  previewWidth="min-content"
>
  <PageContainerWide />
</Example>

**Use cases include:**
- Dashboards 
- Tables 
- Lists
- Charts

#### Narrow
- The "narrow" option scales the content width until a maximum width of `768px`. 
- If the screen is wider than 768px, the Page Container will be center aligned 
and white space will be displayed around the perimeter of the content. 

<Example
  caption='Diagram displaying how a "narrow" Page Container scales horizontally relative to 
    the App Container. The App Container fills the viewport while the "narrow" 
    Page Container reaches a maximum width.'
  pad="none"
  previewWidth="min-content"
>
  <PageContainerNarrow />
</Example>

**Use cases include:**
- Wizards 
- Articles 
- Single task flows, such as forms
- Admin and user settings

#### Full
- This option will automatically resize the container to fill the 
screen displaying it.
- With the "full" option, if the screen grows wider than the available content, the 
Page Content will be left aligned to the edge of the screen.

<Example
  caption='Diagram displaying how a "full" Page Container scales horizontally relative to 
    the App Container. Both the App Container and "full" Page Container fill the viewport.'
  pad="none"
  previewWidth="min-content"
>
  <PageContainerFull />
</Example>

**Use cases may include:**
- Charts 
- Maps 
- Tables

### Page Container Widths Demonstration

Open the following example in "fullscreen mode" and resize your browser window to see how 
each [page container width's](/templates/page-layouts#page-container-widths) maximum width, 
contents padding, and alignment gracefully adjust across screens ranging from very narrow 
to very wide. 

<Example
  screenContainer
  showResponsiveControls={['fullScreen']}
  // height value chosen to best visually represent the page layout diagram concept
  height={{min: '625px'}}
>
  <PageContainerInteractive />
</Example>

## Layouts for Page Content

For specific guidelines and templates regarding Page Content, see [Content Layouts](/templates/content-layouts).

<Link href="/templates/content-layouts" passHref>
  <Button 
    primary 
    label="See Content Layouts" 
    icon={<FormNext />} 
    alignSelf="start" 
    reverse 
    size="large"
  />
</Link>
