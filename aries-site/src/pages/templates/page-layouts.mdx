## Elements of an app UI

The User Interface (UI) for an HPE application consists of four
building blocks: App Container, Global Header and Footer, Page, and
PageContent.

<Example
  caption='Diagram of the "building blocks" composing an application 
    user interface: an App Container which contains the Global Header & Footer, Page  
    and PageContent.'
  pad="none"
  previewWidth="min-content"
>
  <AppAnatomy />
</Example>

1. **App container**

- The container serves as the outer shell of a page UI.
- This is the parent component containing all HTML elements within a grid.
- Its responsibility is to organize each of the page components, how they
  relate to eachother, the spacing between each, and how they respond at
  various screen widths.

2. **Global header and footer**

- The Global Header, also known as the [HPE Common Header and Footer
  Web Service](/templates/global-header), provides a tunable, yet consistent
  header and footer to be used across all HPE applications.
- No matter the screen size, the Global Header & Footer will always be full
  width, occupying as much space as available.

3. **Page**

- The Page component dictates the max width, padding, and alignment of its child PageContent(s).
- It is responsible for the layout for the main content of a page.
- Page `kind` can be [Wide](#wide-default), [Narrow](#narrow), of [Full](#full).

4. **PageContent**

- The PageContent contains the Page Header and any other content.
- Its max width, padding, and alignment is determined by what Page `kind` it is in.

<Box direction="row" align="center" gap="3xsmall">
  <Clock />
  <Text weight="bold" size="large">
    Coming soon:
  </Text>
</Box>

## Page and PageContent

Page is the parent component that wraps around all content for a page. Page dictates what max width, padding, and alignment its child PageContent components should receive.

PageContent contains the Page Header and any other content.

To make the following functionality easy to implement, Grommet provides
[Page and PageContent components](/components/page).

<Example
  caption="Diagram of a Page component and child PageContent. The PageContent component contains the Page Header and other content."
  pad="none"
  previewWidth="min-content"
>
  <PageAnatomy />
</Example>

### Page kinds

There are 3 Page kinds from which to choose, depending on
the layout use case: [Wide](#wide-default), [Narrow](#narrow) and [Full](#full).

The Page `kind` determines the max width that PageContent can reach.

In all cases, the minimum width of content is `336px`, after which horizontal
scrolling is enabled.

#### Wide (default)

- This is the default width for the PageContent.
- Using the "wide" Page scales the PageContent until a maximum width of `1536px`.
- If the screen is larger than `1536px`, the PageContent will be center aligned and white space
  will be displayed around the perimeter of the content.

<Example
  caption={`Diagram displaying how a "wide" Page scales its PageContent 
  horizontally. The Page fills the viewport while the PageContent is 
  restricted to a maximum width.`}
  pad="none"
  previewWidth="min-content"
>
  <PageContainerWide />
</Example>

**Use cases include:**

- Dashboards
- Tables
- Lists
- Charts

#### Narrow

- The "narrow" Page scales the PageContent until a maximum width of `768px`.
- If the screen is wider than 768px, the PageContent will be center aligned
  and white space will be displayed around the perimeter of the content.

<Example
  caption={`Diagram displaying how a "narrow" Page scales its PageContent 
  horizontally. The Page fills the viewport while the PageContent is 
  restricted to a maximum width.`}
  pad="none"
  previewWidth="min-content"
>
  <PageContainerNarrow />
</Example>

**Use cases include:**

- Wizards
- Articles
- Single task flows, such as forms
- Admin and user settings

#### Full

- The "full" Page will automatically resize the PageContent to fill the
  screen displaying it.
- With the "full" option, if the screen grows wider than the available content, the
  PageContent will be left aligned to the edge of the screen.

<Example
  caption={`Diagram displaying how a "full" Page scales horizontally. Both 
  the "full" Page and PageContent fill the viewport.`}
  pad="none"
  previewWidth="min-content"
>
  <PageContainerFull />
</Example>

**Use cases may include:**

- Charts
- Maps
- Tables

#### Page padding

Page padding is the left and right space between the page content and the
screen edge.

Wider padding is better for larger screens, as it creates more whitespace
either side of the content. For smaller screens, less whitespace is appropriate
in order to maximize the available screen real estate.

<Example
  caption="A diagram showing the margin area on a larger and smaller screens."
  plain
  pad="xsmall"
  previewWidth="xlarge"
  height={{ min: 'xsmall' }}
>
  <PageMarginAnatomy />
</Example>

[Responsive breakpoints](/templates/content-layouts#breakpoints) determine the amount of horizontal
padding to be used at various screen widths.

| Breakpoint | Pad (pixels) |
| ---------- | -----------: |
| **xsmall** |           12 |
| **small**  |           24 |
| **medium** |           24 |
| **large**  |           48 |
| **xlarge** |           48 |

### PageContent widths demonstration

Open the following example in "fullscreen mode" and resize your browser window to see how
each [page content width's](#page-kinds) maximum width,
contents padding, and alignment gracefully adjust across screens ranging from very narrow
to very wide.

{/* height value chosen to best visually represent the page layout diagram concept */}

<Example
  screenContainer
  showResponsiveControls={['fullScreen']}
