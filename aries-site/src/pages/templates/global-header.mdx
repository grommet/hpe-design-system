## When to use

For all products that exist within the HPE GreenLake ecosystem, Global Header with the HPE GreenLake badge should be used.

If a product does not exist within the HPE GreenLake ecosystem, use the [HPE Common Header and Footer Web Service](#hpe-common-header-and-footer-web-service).

## Implementing the Global Header

### For designers

The Global Header is published as a Figma component in the HPE Design System Component Library.

<Button
  alignSelf="start"
  label="View Global Header in Figma"
  icon={<Figma color="plain" />}
  href="https://www.figma.com/file/5uOrsL2qk8XwwH8C1ZpDb6/HPE-Design-System-Components?node-id=3028%3A58403"
  secondary
/>

### For developers

<Notification
  status="info"
  message={`Please note that implementation details are still being worked out.`}
  width={{ min: 'medium', max: 'large' }}
  margin={{ bottom: 'medium' }}
/>

While the specifics of the Global Header implementation are still being worked out, we do know that the Global Header will:

- Continue to be delivered as its own service with 24/7 support.
- Be distributed as a Web Component which can be easily consumed by any UI framework.

In the meantime, the [Global Header Figma component](https://www.figma.com/file/5uOrsL2qk8XwwH8C1ZpDb6/HPE-Design-System-Components?node-id=3028%3A58403) should be referenced for the latest design specs.

## HPE Common Header and Footer Web Service

For HPE applications that exist outside of the HPE GreenLake ecosystem, the HPE Common Header and Footer Web Service provides a tunable, yet consistent header and footer. It is provided as a service and injected into your application at run-time.

### Guidelines

The HPE Common Header is a standardized header to be used across applications. HPE [provides an implementation](https://h50007.www5.hpe.com/hfws-test-pages/common-hfws-test-page.php)
to be referenced from your application. Both the header and footer are customizable, allowing consumers to choose various features to enable such as country selector,
shopping cart, HPE passport login, privacy statement links, theme mode, and more.

Each site or application will have different needs. Some header options may not make sense for some
sites. The following sections will help you decide which options to include.

### What makes up the HPE Common Header?

The full common header with all options enabled looks like this:

<Example previewWidth="xlarge" height="xsmall" plain>
  <DiagramPreview
    src={{
      dark: '/templateImages/globalheader-full.svg',
      light: '/templateImages/globalheader-full.svg',
    }}
    alt="HPE Common Header"
  />
</Example>

To configure what parts are shown in the common header for your site, go to the
[HPE Common HFWS test page](https://h50007.www5.hpe.com/hfws-test-pages/common-hfws-test-page.php?version=latest.r&cc_ll=us%2Fen&header_logo=&slim_footer=true&hide_search=true&hide_cart=true&hide_country_selector=true&hide_sign_in=true).
There you can choose various options and hit `Submit`. The common header at the top
of that page will change to include those options, and the code sample on that page will
change to declare the chosen options as parameters in
`<script src="https://h50007.www5.hpe.com/hfws/us/en/hpe/latest.r/root?...">` element that
configures the header.

You can then copy the URL from that `<script>` and use it in the code sample at the top of
this page to configure the common header and footer for your site.

Let's take a closer look at each part of the common header and footer.

#### App Identity

Most sites should choose the default which will be the HPE logo for regular mode or the HPE GreenLake logo for
`console` mode. You can force it to use one or the other by specifically choosing HPE versus HPE GreenLake if
needed.

![HPE GreenLake logo](/templateImages/globalheader-greenlake.png)

#### Header Main Navigation

The main navigation in the center of the header provide marketing content. The links allow users to find
HPE products, contact support and get more information about HPE. These should also typically be enabled
for most sites.

![Global Header Main Navigation example](/templateImages/globalheader-nav.png)

#### Search

<Search /> The *Search* icon allows the user to search hpe.com.{' '}

#### Shopping Cart

<Shop /> The *Shopping Cart* icon goes to the HPE shopping cart for buy.hpe.com.
This should only be enabled for sites which have products or solutions for sale.

#### Country Selector

<Language /> The country selector allows the user to go to a language-specific
version of hpe.com. This should be disabled for most sites since the link really
only takes you back to hpe.com instead of staying on your site.

#### Sign in

![Sign In button](/templateImages/globalheader-sign-in.png)
Sign in allows the user to sign in to their HPE Passport account for hpe.com. Enable this
option if your site uses features that require a Passport login.

#### Cube Menu

<AppsRounded /> The *Cube Menu* allows access to HPE services available to the
user such as HPE GreenLake and other Cloud console applications as well as
general HPE links for HPE content like developer.hpe.com, education.hpe.com,
etc. This menu should be enabled to allow access to other HPE sites and
applications.

#### Color Scheme

**Color Scheme** allows implementors to choose either a light or dark variant of the header/footer.
The color scheme you choose should be harmonious with the primary background of your application's
header and avoid stark contrast which interrupts a user's visual flow. If your application supports
light and dark modes, consider setting the `color_scheme` parameter with a value of either `light`
or `dark` in alignment with the user's preference.

### What makes up the HPE Common Footer?

The common footer contains links for privacy information and various opt-out and choices required by
European GDPR standards as well US and other privacy requirements. In general these links should
be enabled for customer-facing sites.

#### Privacy Link

The _Privacy_ link goes to HPE's Privacy Statement which explains how HPE manages and protects a users
information and respects the relevant privacy standards like GDPR, APEC, etc.

#### Terms of Use Link

The _Terms of Use_ link goes to the legal statement that governs the user's activity on HPE's websites.

#### Ad Choices and Cookies Link

The _Ad Choices and Cookies_ link goes to the section of the _Privacy Statement_ that explains how
cookies are used as well as how you can opt-out of targetted advertisements and analytics data
such as Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics.

#### Do Not Sell My Personal Information Link

The _Do Not Sell My Personal Information_ link goes to information on how to opt-out of any sale
of personal collected by automatic data collection tools.
