The Global Header, also known as the HPE Common Header and Footer Web Service,
provides a tunable, yet consistent header and footer to be used across all HPE
applications. The header is provided as a service and injected into your
application at run-time.

## Guidelines

The Global Header is a standardized header to be used across applications. HPE [provides an implementation](https://h50007.www5.hpe.com/hfws-test-pages/common-hfws-test-page.php)
to be referenced from your application. Both the header and footer are customizable, allowing consumers to choose various features to enable such as country selector,
shopping cart, HPE passport login, privacy statement links, theme mode, and more.

Each site or application will have different needs. Some header options may not make sense for some
sites. The following sections will help you decide which options to include.

## What makes up the Global Header?

The full global header with all options enabled looks like this:

![Full HPE Global Header](/templateImages/globalheader-full.png)

To configure what parts are shown in the global header for your site, go to the
[HPE Common HFWS test page](https://h50007.www5.hpe.com/hfws-test-pages/common-hfws-test-page.php?version=latest.r&cc_ll=us%2Fen&header_logo=&slim_footer=true&hide_search=true&hide_cart=true&hide_country_selector=true&hide_sign_in=true).
There you can choose various options and hit `Submit`. The global header at the top
of that page will change to include those options, and the code sample on that page will 
change to declare the chosen options as parameters in
`<script src="https://h50007.www5.hpe.com/hfws/us/en/hpe/latest.r/root?...">` element that
configures the header.

You can then copy the URL from that `<script>` and use it in the code sample at the top of
this page to configure the global header and footer for your site.

Let's take a closer look at each part of the global header and footer.

### App Identity

Most sites should choose the default which will be the HPE logo for regular mode or the GreenLake logo for
`console` mode. You can force it to use one or the other by specifically choosing HPE versus GreenLake if
needed.

### Header Main Navigation

The main navigation in the center of the header provide marketing content. The links allow users to find
HPE products, contact support and get more information about HPE. These should also typically be enabled
for most sites.

### Search

<Search /> The *Search* icon allows the user to search hpe.com. 

### Shopping Cart

<Shop /> The *Shopping Cart* icon goes to the HPE shopping cart for buy.hpe.com. This should only
be enabled for sites which have products or solutions for sale.


### Country Selector

<Language /> The country selector allows the user to go to a language-specific version of hpe.com. This
should be disabled for most sites since the link really only takes you back to hpe.com
instead of staying on your site.


### Sign in

![Sign In button](/templateImages/globalheader-sign-in.png)
Sign in allows the user to sign in to their HPE Passport account for hpe.com. Enable this
option if your site uses features that require a Passport login.


### Cube Menu

<AppsRounded /> The *Cube Menu* allows access to HPE services available to the user such as GreenLake and
other Cloud console applications as well as general HPE links for HPE content like
developer.hpe.com, education.hpe.com, etc. This menu should be enabled to allow access
to other HPE sites and applications.

### Color Scheme

**Color Scheme** allows implementors to choose either a light or dark variant of the header/footer.
The color scheme you choose should be harmonious with the primary background of your application's
header and avoid stark contrast which interrupts a user's visual flow. If your application supports
light and dark modes, consider setting the `color_scheme` parameter with a value of either `light`
or `dark` in alignment with the user's preference.

## What makes up the Global footer?

The global footer contains links for privacy information and various opt-out and choices required by
European GDPR standards as well US and other privacy requirements. In general these links should
be enabled for customer-facing sites.

### Privacy Link

The *Privacy* link goes to HPE's Privacy Statement which explains how HPE manages and protects a users
information and respects the relevant privacy standards like GDPR, APEC, etc.

### Terms of Use Link

The *Terms of Use* link goes to the legal statement that governs the user's activity on HPE's websites.

### Ad Choices and Cookies Link

The *Ad Choices and Cookies* link goes to the section of the *Privacy Statement* that explains how
cookies are used as well as how you can opt-out of targetted advertisements and analytics data
such as Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics.


### Do Not Sell My Personal Information Link

The *Do Not Sell My Personal Information* link goes to information on how to opt-out of any sale
of personal collected by automatic data collection tools.
