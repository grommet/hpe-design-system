## Guidelines

The Global Header is a standardized header to be used across applications. HPE provides an implementation
that you can reference from your application. You can choose various features to enable like country selector,
shopping cart and HPE passport login, etc. You can also enable or disable the page footer with privacy statement
link, terms of use, ad choices and cookies, and *Do Not Sell My Information* links.

## What makes up the Global Header?

### App Identity

Most sites should choose the default which will be the HPE logo for regular mode or the GreenLake logo for
`console` mode. You can force it to use one or the other by specifically choosing HPE versus GreenLake if
needed.
