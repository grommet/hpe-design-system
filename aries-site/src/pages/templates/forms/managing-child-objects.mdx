This pattern improves productivity by focusing a user's attention solely on the current 
object of interest, and uses collapsible objects to show or hide detail as needed. The 
intent is that collapsible objects reduce noise, clutter, and cognitive overload 
by hiding extraneous detail &mdash; and an easy means to view detail when needed.

## When to use

Use when a user's primary task is to create or configure a parent resource, but creating, 
updating, or removing child objects is a sub-task. This pattern provides users control 
to easily show and hide detail as needed.

## Anatomy

The following illustrates the elements composing a child object in its collapsed and expanded 
states. View the [use case examples](#use-case-examples) to see how child objects behave and are presented in a form 
context.

### Collapsed state

| Label | Region         | Purpose                                                    | Required | Notes |
| ----- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | :------: | ----- |
|       | Container      | Identfies the child and controls the show detail behavior. | <Checkmark a11yTitle="true" size="small" /> | The entirety of the container is focusable and expands to show detail with a mouse click, Enter key, or Spacebar. The aria-label should read "Show and edit detail." |
|       | Label          | Uniquely identifies each child object.                     | <Checkmark a11yTitle="true" size="small" /> | Should be implemented as a semantically correct heading to allow screen reader users to traverse between children. |
|       | Expand icon    | Visual treatment indicating show detail behavior.          | <Checkmark a11yTitle="true" size="small" /> | Icon name is "FormDown". | 
|       | Values summary | A preview summarizing the object's detail.                 | Optional |       |
|       | Border         | Provides visual distinction from other children.           | <Checkmark a11yTitle="true" size="small" /> |       |

### Expanded state

| Label | Region        | Purpose                                                     | Required | Notes |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | :------: | ----- |
|       | Header        | Identifies the child and controls the hide detail behavior. | <Checkmark a11yTitle="true" size="small" /> | The entirety of the container is focusable and hides detail with a mouse click, Enter key, or Spacebar. The aria-label should read "Hide detail." |
|       | Label         | Uniquely identifies each child object.                      | <Checkmark a11yTitle="true" size="small" /> | Should be implemented as a semantically correct heading to allow screen reader users to traverse between children. |
|       | Collapse icon | Visual treatment indicating hide detail behavior.           | <Checkmark a11yTitle="true" size="small" /> | Icon name is "FormUp". |
|       | Body          | Flexible region for presenting an object's detail.          | <Checkmark a11yTitle="true" size="small" /> | Detail presentation may vary by the use case. |
|       | Remove button | Removes/deletes the child from its parent.                  | <Checkmark a11yTitle="true" size="small" /> |       | 
|       | Border        | Provides visual distinction from other children.            | <Checkmark a11yTitle="true" size="small" /> |       |
