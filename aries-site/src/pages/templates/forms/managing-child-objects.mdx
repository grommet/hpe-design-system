## When to use

The managing child objects pattern may be used when creating, updating, or removing 
child objects is part of a larger flow where a parent resource is being created or 
configured. In these circumstances, the additional configuration inputs can crowd screens 
and lead to quite lengthy forms.

This pattern improves productivity by focusing a user's attention solely on the current object 
of interest, and uses collapsible objects to show or hide detail as needed. The 
intent is that collapsible objects reduce noise, clutter, and the resulting cognitive overload 
by hiding extraneous detail &mdash; and an easy means to view detail when needed.

## Anatomy

The following illustrates the elements composing a child object in its collapsed and expanded 
states. View the [use case examples](#use-case-examples) to see how child objects behave and are presented in a form 
context.

### Collapsed state

[Diagram to be inserted]

| Label | Region         | Purpose                                                    | Required? | Notes |
| ----- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----- |
|       | Container      | Identfies the child and controls the show detail behavior. | Required  | The entirety of the container is focusable and shows detail with a mouse click, Enter key, or Spacebar. The aria-label should read "Show and edit detail." |
|       | Label          | Uniquely identifies each child object.                     | Required  | Should be implemented as a semantically correct heading to allow screen reader users to traverse between children. |
|       | Expand icon    | Visual treatment indicating show detail behavior.          | Required  | Icon name is "FormDown". | 
|       | Values summary | A preview summarizing the object's detail.                 | Optional  |       |
|       | Border         | Provides visual distinction from other children.           | Required  |       |

### Expanded state

| Label | Region        | Purpose                                                     | Required? | Notes |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----- |
|       | Header        | Identifies the child and controls the hide detail behavior. | Required  | The entirety of the container is focusable and hides detail with a mouse click, Enter key, or Spacebar. The aria-label should read "Hide detail." |
|       | Label         | Uniquely identifies each child object.                      | Required  | Should be implemented as a semantically correct heading to allow screen reader users to traverse between children. |
|       | Collapse icon | Visual treatment indicating hide detail behavior.           | Required  | Icon name is "FormUp". |
|       | Body          | Flexible region for presenting an object's detail.          | Required  | Detail presentation may vary by the use case. |
|       | Remove button | Removes/deletes the child from its parent.                  | Required  |       | 
|       | Border        | Provides visual distinction from other children.            | Required  |       |
