## Elements of an App UI
The User Interface (UI) for an HPE application consists of three 
building blocks: App Container, Global Header and Footer, and 
Page Container.

--INSERT-EXAMPLE-HERE--

1. **App Container**  
The container serves as the outer shell of a page UI. This is the 
parent component containing all HTML elements within a grid. It's 
responsibility is to organize each of the page components, how they 
relate to each other, the spacing between each, and how they respond 
at various screen widths.

2. **Global Header & Footer**  
The Global Header, also known as the HPE Common Header and Footer 
Web Service, provides a tunable, yet consistent header and footer 
to be used across all HPE applications. For more information, see 
[Global Header](/templates/global-header).

3. **Page Container**  
The Page Container contains the Page Content and the Page Header. 
It is responsible for the layout for the main content of a page.

## Responsive Layouts
App layouts should be designed to be adaptable to different screen sizes 
depending on the user input. Our goal, as designers and developers at HPE, 
should be to create optimal and accessible user experiences regardless of 
screen size or resolution.

## Page Container
The Page Container is responsible for the layout for the main content of a page.
It contains a page's [Page Header](/components/header#header-for-a-single-page) 
and its Page Content.

### Container Width
There are 3 content width options from which to choose, depending on 
the layout use case: [Wide](#wide-default), [Narrow](#narrow) and [Full](#full). 

In all cases, the minimum width of content is `336px`, after which horizontal 
scrolling is enabled.

#### Wide (default)
This is the default width for the Page Container. Using the "wide" content width 
scales the Page Container until a maximum width of `1608px`. If the screen is 
larger than `1608px`, the Page Container will be center aligned and white space 
will be displayed around the perimeter of the content.

Use cases include:
- Dashboards 
- Tables 
- Lists
- Charts

#### Narrow
The "narrow" option scales the content width until a maximum width of `768px`. 
If the screen is larger than 768, the Page Container will be center aligned 
and white space will be displayed around the perimeter of the content.

Use cases include:
- Wizards 
- Articles 
- Single task flows, such as forms
- Admin and user settings

#### Full
This option will automatically resize the container to fill the 
screen displaying it. With the "full" option, if the screen grows wider 
than the available content, the Page Container will be left aligned to 
the edge of the screen.

### Grid
Grommet uses a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox. CSS Grid 
allows for the creation of custom grids depending on specific 
content needs. Items on smaller screens no longer have to stack 
in the order they are arranged on desktop (unless that is the 
desired output). 

#### Ordering items based on content needs
Focusing on content needs can help us create better optimal user 
experiences &mdash; think about which piece of content a user is likely 
to interact with first and order items on the page accordingly. 

Specifying layout content in this way will also ensure that it 
is interepreted appropriately by screen readers for visually 
impaired users.

#### Grid Spacing
Grid allows you to specify row and columns sizes, as well as define 
margin and gap sizing. The HPE Design System components and templates 
have grid sizing built in, but when you need them to craft your digital 
experience, use these values as a reference:

**Row and Column Sizes**  

| T-shirt Size | Dimension (pixels) |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| xxsmall      | 48   |
| xsmall       | 96   |  
| small        | 192  |  
| medium       | 384  |  
| large        | 768  |  
| xlarge       | 1152 |  
| xxlarge      | 1536 |  
| full         | 100% |

**Margin, Pad and Gap Sizes**  

| T-shirt Size | Dimension (pixels) |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| none         | 0  |   
| hair         | 1  |   
| xxsmall      | 3  |   
| xsmall       | 6  |   
| small        | 12 |   
| medium       | 24 |   
| large        | 48 |   
| xlarge       | 96 | 

### Breakpoints
A breakpoint is a specified width at which the content and page 
design adapt, providing the best user experience for that viewport 
dimension. For designers, breakpoints help stress test and 
validate UX decisions around page layouts.

--INSERT-TABLE-HERE--

Margin is the left and right space between the main content of a 
page and the screen's edge.

Based on the screen size, the page margin differs at each 
breakpoint. Wider margins are better for larger screens, as they 
create more whitespace around the perimeter of the content. Similarly, 
smaller margins are appropriate for smaller screens, as they  
maximize the screen real estate available.
