## Guidance

Persistent navigation aids users by maintaining context of where they are within an application. This presence eases the user experience, especially in information rich applications. This pattern can be applied in both local and global contexts.

### When to Use Persistent Navigation

Persistent navigation should be used when:

- A user needs to easy access to move from one area of an application to another with minimal clicks.
- Elements such as branding or search are present since they require a ubiquitous presence.

## Variants

Persistent navigation can be executed in several forms such as headers, app bars, and sidebars. Regardless of choice, attentiveness to how each of these forms present and behave on various device sizes is critical. In the variants below, pay special attention to how they behave in mobile contexts.

### Header as Persistent Navigation

Headers often contain persistent elements such as search, session, and branding, plus navigation links. When executed as a header, navigation choices should contain no more than four to five elements.

Be sure to check out [Header](/components/header) to see the many variants and versatility Header enables.

  template
  width="100%"
>
  <HeaderNavExample />
</Example>

### Minimal Sidebar

It is recommended that Sidebar limits the number of navigation choices to 5-7, as navigation choices are often mixed with elements such as user or session.

Sidebars transform to a horizontal orientation on mobile devices. Be sure to use the "See Fullscreen" in the example below to explore the minimal sidebar's behavior on mobile-sized screens.
