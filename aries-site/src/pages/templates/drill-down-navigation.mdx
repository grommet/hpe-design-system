Drill Down Navigation allows for a consistent
and focused experience that helps eliminate cognitive overload.

## When to Use
- When users need to focus on one task at a time.
- To provide summary information with the ability to drill down into specifics.
- When screen real estate is limited.
- When designing for many levels of functionality.
- To divide content into meaningful, focussed sections.
- When the user is moving forward step-by-step to access further information.
- When going from your Account > Services > Service.
- To allow users to dive deeper into related content.

## Guidelines
- Can be used as an individual element or in groups of related content.
- Each element should have its own single content.

## Drill Down Navigation Examples

### Card Example
A visual representation of interactive and organized content.

<Example 
  caption="Illustration showing how Cards may be used to navigate from a central hub page to spoke pages of related content and/or more granular detail." 
  plain 
  pad="small" 
  previewWidth="large" 
  height={{ min: 'small' }}
>
  <DiagramPreview 
    src={{
      dark: "/templateImages/drill-down-card-example-invert.svg", 
      light: '/templateImages/drill-down-card-example.svg'
    }} 
    alt="A diagram illustrating drill down navigation within cards." 
  />
</Example>

<Example plain>
  <DrillDownCardExample />
</Example>

### List Example
Lists provide access points that present a collection of organized and related content.

<Example 
  caption="Illustration showing how a user can navigate within a List by clicking an item and be navigated to a page of related content." 
  plain 
  pad="small" 
  previewWidth="large" 
  height={{ min: 'small' }}
>
  <DiagramPreview 
    src={{
      dark: "/templateImages/drill-down-list-example-invert.svg", 
      light: '/templateImages/drill-down-list-example.svg'
    }} 
    alt="A diagram illustrating drill down navigation within lists." />
</Example>

<Example plain>
  <DrillDownListExample />
</Example>

### DataTable Example
Datatables present data in a column and row format. A user can be taken to a spoke when an entire table row is clickable or if an individual cell is clickable to drill down into more information.

<Example 
  caption="Illustration showing how a user may click a DataTable row which navigates to another page with related content, such as a record's detail (spoke) or related hub." 
  plain 
  pad="small" 
  previewWidth="large" 
  height={{ min: 'small' }}
>
  <DiagramPreview 
    src={{
      dark: "/templateImages/drill-down-datatable-example-invert.svg",
      light: '/templateImages/drill-down-datatable-example.svg'
      }} 
      alt="A diagram illustrating drill down navigation within a DataTable." />
</Example>

<Example plain>
  <DrillDownDataTableExample />
