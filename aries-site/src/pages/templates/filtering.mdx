## What makes up filtering?

Filtering allows data to be narrowed down around a set of specified parameters. When users may not have a specific record in mind but are seeking to group data around a certain set of attributes, filtering should be used to allow the user to narrow the data and take action on relevant records.

If a user will likely be looking for a specific record as opposed to groups of data, consider implementing search.

### Controls

Filter controls should live above the data content and facilitate a user's ability to locate and take actions against records of interest.

### Filters

The way filters are displayed is dependent on the use case, number of filters, and data types of the content. These [general guidelines](#guidelines) are a starting point for how to present filtering in your application, but it's important to consider each recommendation in the context of your application's use cases.

### Results

Results should live below the controls and display any records that meet filter criteria.
Depending on the data types and use case, results may be represented by a
[List](/templates/lists), [Cards](/components/card), or [DataTable](/components/datatable).

### Pagination

If the number of records displayed per page is limited, pagination should be placed underneath the results.

## When to use

### Filters in a layer

When applying many filters at once, it is helpful to present them in a consolidated [Layer](/components/layer).

<Example
  code={[
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/filtering/FilteringLists/FilteringLists.js',
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/filtering/FilteringLists/mockData.js',
  ]}
  showResponsiveControls={['laptop', 'mobile']}
  template
>
  <FilteringLists />
</Example>

### Filtering with selectable results

The summary displayed beneath the search input should always reflect the user's actions. When filtering is combined with selection, the summary text should adjust for the following scenarios:

- No filters, no selections &mdash; The summary should read "X items", where X is the total number of items.
- Filters applied, no selections &mdash; The summary should read "X results of Y items".
- Selections made &mdash; The summary should read "X of Y items selected", where Y is the total number of results that meet the filter criteria or the total number of items if no filtering has been applied.

## Guidelines

Filtering should help users quickly narrow down data sets by selecting certain parameters to define the relevant data bounds. Different types of inputs may better suited for filtering depending on the type of data.

Use your best judgement around which input type is appropriate for the data you are filtering. However, here are a few things to consider:

- **Is data presented as Cards or List?** When there is ample screen space, display the
  filters to the left of the data as a persistent column. Once space
  becomes limited, use a single filter button that opens a Layer containing the filters.
- **Is there more than one filter?** Use a single button with filter icon that
  [opens a Layer containing the filters](/templates/filtering).
- When only one item can be selected from a list, use the [Select](/components/select) component.
- **Is the user going to be selecting from 4 or fewer multiple selection options?** Filter with
  [CheckBoxGroup](#filters-in-a-center-layer).
- **If the filter set allows for multiple selections and there are 5 or more items to choose from?** Use [SelectMultiple](/components/SelectMultiple).
- When the data contains 10 or more items, consider including search in your [SelectMultiple](/components/SelectMultiple) implementation.
- **Is the user aiming to filter based on a range?** Filter with
  [RangeSelector](#filtering-with-rangeselector).

## More examples of filtering

### Filtering with RangeSelector

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/filtering/FilteringWithRangeSelector.js"
  template
  showResponsiveControls={['laptop', 'mobile']}
>
  <FilteringWithRangeSelector />
</Example>

### Filtering with Select

Filtering with Select should be used when the goal of the user will likely be to filter data around one specific criteria. If the user will be selecting multiple criteria, consider using CheckBoxGroup.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/filtering/FilteringWithSelect.js"
  template
  showResponsiveControls={['laptop', 'mobile']}
>
  <FilteringWithSelect />
</Example>
