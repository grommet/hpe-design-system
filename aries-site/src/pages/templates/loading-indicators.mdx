## Best Practices

- Use Loading Indicators only when the page takes more than a few seconds to load, otherwise simply display the content.
- Choose the variant according to the use case and apply only one at a time.
- Avoid displaying multiple instances of the same loading indicator.
- Do not artificially prolong loading times for the sake of animation.
- Whenever possible, allow uninterrupted system usage during lengthy processes.

## Variants

Different loading indicators can be used for specific use cases.

### Skeleton

Skeletons are used for content-rich interfaces, with asynchronous loading, to stabilize layout and prevent shifts during content retrieval. The most common use case is for full page loads. For more information, access [Skeleton.](/components/skeleton)

<Example
  componentName="Skeleton"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/skeleton/DashBoardSkeletonExample.js"

  height="500px"
  align="start"
  overflow="auto"
  width="100%"

  <DashBoardSkeletonExample />
</Example>

### Spinner

Spinners are used for in-context operations, like to notify the user that a task is being processed or that data is being fetched. For more information, access [Spinner.](/components/spinner)

### Busy Button

Busy Buttons are used to notify the user that the submission of a form is being processed. For more information, access [Busy Button.](/components/button?q=button#busy-button)
