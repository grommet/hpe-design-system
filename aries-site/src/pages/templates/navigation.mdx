View navigation patterns and templates for HPE applications, learn how to incorporate Global Sidebar into applications living in the HPE as-a-service ecosystem, and see how to implement leading React routing packages with navigation templates.

## Patterns

Recommended patterns, templates, and examples for use within the context of a single application, website, or subsection within an application. Plus, demonstration for how local navigation patterns, such as [Hub & Spoke](/templates/hub-and-spoke-navigation) and [Persistent Navigation](/templates/persistent-navigation), may be combined with the [Global Sidebar](/extend/global-sidebar) for easy maneuverability across applications within the HPE ecosystem.

### Navigation Within an Application

Flexible in nature, the following patterns can be applied to present contextual, supplemental, and hierachical needs within an application or subsection of a larger application.

- [Hub & Spoke patterns](/templates/hub-and-spoke-navigation) lend themselves well to applications primarily concerned with task execution.
- Reach for [Persistent Navigation](/templates/persistent-navigation) when a user needs orientation or easy access to application sections.
