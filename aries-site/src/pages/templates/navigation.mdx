Navigation is the overall structure providing users screen direction to complete a task logically and easily through a website or an application. 

Part of creating a seamless application or interface is creating an obvious flow from one view or interaction to the next. Think of navigation as a story map where you help guide your user through each process. 

## Types of Navigation

Pages and content of a site or service are typically organized in an information hierarchy. Different types of navigation provide for traversing this hierarchy according to diverse user tasks. 
There are 5 different types of navigational directions a user can maneuver in.

**Drill Down**: used when the user wants to get more content for something or the user wants to see a higher level of content for the site/app than the current page shows.

**Side-to-Side**: used to go to the next or previous sibling of the current page, typically when the user is scanning across similar items.

**Reverse Navigation** (built in the web browser): used to go back to the previous visited page utilizing the browsers built-in back button

**Matrix**: used to go to a different place in the content hierarchy that isn't a direct parent or child of the current page in the content hierarchy.

**Ascending Navigation**: used to direct the user up the hierarchy to the parent page when on a child page.

## What makes navigation successful

Users should always be able to tell where they are on a page, application or product and should be predictable as to how they can get to the next step or destination. A task has a start and an end point so it is important to keep the functionality or task(s) in mind when creating products with common user experiences and expectations.

**Follow the points below for successful navigation:**
- Identify the problem.
- Understand what the userâ€™s role is and common processes followed.
- Who is this being intended for and determine thee most common tasks.
