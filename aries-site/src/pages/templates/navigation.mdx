Navigation is the overall structure providing users screen direction to complete a task logically and easily through a website or an application. 

Part of creating a seamless application or interface is creating an obvious flow from one view or interaction to the next. Think of navigation as a story map where you help guide your user through each process. 

## Types of Navigation

There are 4 different types of navigational directions a user can maneuver in:

<CardGrid cards={navCards} />

## What makes navigation successful

Users should always be able to tell where they are on a page, application or product and should be predictable as to how they can get to the next step or destination. A task has a start and an end point so it is important to keep the functionality or task(s) in mind when creating products with common user experiences and expectations.

**Follow the points below for successful navigation:**
- Identify the problem.
- Understand what the user’s role is and common processes followed.
