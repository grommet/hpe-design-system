## Guidance

Dashboards provide users peace-of-mind knowing critical measures, applications, and services are healthy; plus, easy access to areas needing attention for the moments when they are not.

Well designed dashboards begin by defining the specific purpose and user needs it is serving.

Operational dashboards focus on delivering information such as data deviations, current resources, and resource statuses so that users can proactively execute time-sensitive tasks.

Analytical dashboards present comparison, relationship, and distribution data supporting analysis and decision making.

Regardless of need, each of these templates deliver at-a-glance critical information and quick navigation to underlying detail.
