## When to Use:

- When the user may want to return to the previous pageâ€™s content
- When the user may want to trace through their steps chronologically to return to past page content
- For web applications, as all web browsers contain built in chronological content buttons

## Reverse Navigation Examples:

### In-App Example
Provide a context button for when it is valuable to provide users explicitly around where they are returning to.

<Example caption="Diagram illustrating reverse navigation." plain pad="small" previewWidth="large" height={{ min: 'small' }}>
<DiagramPreview src={{dark: "/BackButton.svg", light: '/BackButton-invert.svg'}} alt="Diagram showing an in-app back button that provides the user with context around where they will return to after clicking the button." />
</Example>


**Guidelines:**
- Although all web browsers provide built-in reverse navigation, consider adding in-app back buttons when reverse 
navigation is expected and the user may need help maintaining context on their journey. This is especially 
helpful when the app has a deep hierarchy with many levels.

### Browser Example
Browsers provide built-in reverse navigation to the previous page visited.

<Example caption="Browser back button preview." plain pad="small" previewWidth="large" height={{ min: 'small' }}>
<DiagramPreview src={{dark: "/browserExampleNavigation.png", light: '/browserExampleNavigation-invert.png'}} alt="Image of the browsers back button to the previous page." />
</Example>

**Guidelines:**
- Reverse navigation will always go back one step and direct the user to the previously visited page.
