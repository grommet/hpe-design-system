## Tabs Example

Tabs are a persistent horizontal bar that is used to navigate between related content without leaving the current page. See the [Tabs page](/components/tabs) for more guidance and examples.

### Tabs Guidelines

- Use only nouns or verbs for labels.
- Use concise 1-2 word labels.
- Use Title Case.
- Avoid nested Tabs.
- Organize information by priority and reading direction (e.g., right to left) of the user.
- Ensure first tab is active when arriving at the page.
- Keep users on same page when navigating between Tabs.
- Use 5-7 Tabs max.

<Example 
  caption="Diagram illustrating how Tabs can provide side-to-side navigation between various sets of related content."
  previewWidth="medium"
  height={{ min: 'small' }}
  plain
>
  <DiagramPreview
    src={{
      dark: "/templateImages/tab-nav-invert.svg", 
      light: "/templateImages/tab-nav.svg"
    }}
    alt="Diagram illustrating how Tabs can provide side-to-side navigation between various sets of related content."
  />
</Example>

<TabCaption />

export const data = {
  Tabs: 'Tabs are lateral sections that control which content you see.',
  Interaction: 'Click and reveal content.',
  Content:
    'Related content that can be divided into sections to present information within the same page.',
};

export const TabCaption = () => (
  <NameValueList
    layout="grid"
    pairProps={{ direction: 'column' }}
    columns={['medium', 'medium']}
  >
    {Object.entries(data).map(([name, value]) => (
      <NameValuePair key={name} name={name}>{value}</NameValuePair>
    ))}
  </NameValueList>
);
