## Tabs Example

Tabs are a persistent horizontal bar that is used to navigate between related content without leaving the current page. See the [Tabs page](/components/tabs) for more guidance and examples.

### Guidelines

- Use only nouns or verbs for labels.
- Use concise 1-2 word labels.
- Use Title Case.
- Avoid nested Tabs.
- Organize information by priority and reading direction (e.g., right to left) of the user.
- Ensure first tab is active when arriving at the page.
- Keep users on same page when navigating between Tabs.
- Use 5-7 Tabs max.

  Interaction: 'Click and reveal content.',
  Content:

    {Object.entries(data).map(([name, value]) => (
      <NameValuePair key={name} name={name}>{value}</NameValuePair>
    ))}
  </NameValueList>
);
