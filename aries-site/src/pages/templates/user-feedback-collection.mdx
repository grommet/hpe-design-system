### When to use
Consider using in app feedback collection for the following use cases:
- Any location where customer insights can help us to improve our experiences.
- To gather data to assist in advocating for changes to the user experience.
- To evaluate the effectiveness of content.

### When not to use
Don’t collect feedback in the following use cases:
- If it disrupts a user flow or is intrusive in any way.
- There is no actionable plan for what to do with the data.
- In locations where users do not have enough context to form a valid opinion. 
- There are too many implementations of user feedback collection, as not to dilute their effectiveness.

### Connecting to Qualtrics
To iniate user feedback collection, please contact doris.singer@hpe.com for the following steps:

1. Doris will set up the survey in Qualtrics.
2. Doris will submit a TEST resposnse for developers to have to use for testing againts api.
3. The dev uses the [Retrieve a Survey Response call](https://api.qualtrics.com/1179a68b7183c-retrieve-a-survey-response) (Survey ID, API Token, and the Response ID required) to pull in the metadata/schema for the test submission. This response is almost identical to what needs to be submitted.
4. Dev uses [Create a New Response](https://api.qualtrics.com/f1cad92018d2b-create-a-new-response) call to send in data.

View in code examples to see example of `post` call that will send the data to Qualtrics.

## Examples

### Solicited Feedback
Solicited feedback is a flow in which we are interupting the user at the end of a task flow for feedback on the task they just completed. 

Click on "Power 1 Device" to see the progressive example of the feedback questions.

### UnSolicited Feedback
Unsolicited feedback example would be where a user is provided a mechanism (like a “suggestions box”) to ask questions, make recommendations etc.
