Feedback collected from users provides qualitative insights into users' perception of ease-of-use
and value delivered. Qualitative measures compliment quantitative usage and interaction data
to form a well-rounded analytic picture of the customer experience.

## When to use

When and where to collect feedback from users should be a collaborative effort working with the <a href={`mailto:${contact.email}?subject=Collecting%20user%20feedback%20in%20a%20product%20experience`}>HPE GreenLake Experience Management COE</a>.
This team will work with you to construct a questionnaire aligned with your objectives and
[provide implementation details](#feedback-setup-and-submission) such as API credentials and endpoints for submitting
feedback responses.

In-app feedback collection should be considered where it aids the understanding of users'
perceptions around the ease-of-use and/or satisfaction with particular content, features,
or workflows.

Feedback may be [actively solicited](#solicited-feedback) or [passively collected](#capturing-unsolicited-feedback).

### When not to use

Don’t collect feedback in the following use cases:

- Collecting feedback should not interrupt or impede a user from completing their intended objective.
- There is no actionable plan for what to do with the data.
- In locations where users do not have enough context to form a valid opinion.
- There are too many instances soliciting feedback which can [dilute feedback effectiveness](#sampling-frequency).

### Sampling frequency for actively solicited feedback

Avoid over sampling and/or diluting effectiveness by limiting who is asked for feedback and
how often. Consider implementing "rules of engagement" specifying under what conditions an
individual user should be solicited for feedback. Example engagement rules might be:

- Has not submitted response to this questionnaire in the last 90 days.
- Has not been asked to complete this questionnaire in the last 30 days.
- Has not been asked to complete any questionnaire in the last 7 days.

## Implementation

### Feedback question styling

Feedback surveys are composed with Grommet Form and FormFields containing any input types. Add the
`kind="survey"` prop to Form to apply special survey styling to FormField labels and inputs.

```
<Form
  kind="survey" // Apply feedback styling to form field labels and inputs
  ...
>
  <FormField
    htmlFor="question-1"
    name="QID1"
    label="How was the experience deploying your workload?"
  >
    <ThumbsRating id="question-1" name="QID1" />
  </FormField>
</Form>
```

### Feedback setup and submission

To initiate user feedback collection, please contact the <a href={`mailto:${contact.email}?subject=Collecting%20user%20feedback%20in%20a%20product%20experience`}>HPE GreenLake Experience Management COE</a> for the following steps:

1. The customer experience team will work with you to understand your needs and create a dedicated survey for your use case. At that time, an API token, survey id, and response id will be provided.
1. Map UI survey implementation to the survey's response schema. Use the API token, survey Id, and response Id to obtain the survey response schema with the [retrieve a survey response call](https://api.qualtrics.com/1179a68b7183c-retrieve-a-survey-response). The properties in the "values" object represent the data which should be submitted with each new survey response.
1. Survey responses are submitted using [create a new response](https://api.qualtrics.com/f1cad92018d2b-create-a-new-response).

```
// Submit survey response
fetch(`https://yul1.qualtrics.com/API/v3/surveys/${SURVEY_ID}/responses`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-API-TOKEN': API_TOKEN,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(data),
})
.then(response => {
  // Response handling here
})
.catch(error => {
  // Error handling here
});
```

### Passing non-user data

There may be non-user data that needs to passed as a parameter in the survey response. A good example of this can
be found in the example below click on show "example code" and view the TaskFlowFeedback.js file.
For example you may want to pass the currrent url with user collect data:

```
  const router = useRouter();
  const url = `${router.route}`;
  // The properties within the surveyValues object will be specific to your
  // product and instance within the product. These will be specified
  // when working with the HPE GreenLake Experience Management COE team.
  const surveyValues = {
    fullURL: url,
    QID1: undefined,
    QID2_TEXT: '',
  };

```

## Examples

### Solicited feedback

Solicited feedback is an active method of asking users for their opinions and perspectives.
A feedback questionnaire is presented after a user has completed a task or consumed a piece of
content. Solicited feedback should not interrupt or impede a user from completing their intended
objective.

#### Task flow in center layer

Click on "Power on 1 device" to see the feedback questions presented at the completion of the
power on task flow.

### Unsolicited feedback

Unsolicited feedback provides users the opportunity to ask questions, provide ideas, or
make recommendations. Acting similar to a “suggestions box,” this mechanism is placed in
a persistent location, such as within an app-level menu or embedded with the application's
page layout.
