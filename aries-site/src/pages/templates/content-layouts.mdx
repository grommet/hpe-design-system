Content layouts may be applied across different levels of information hierarchy. At a page 
template level, it can help with the layout of page sections. At an page section level, it can 
coordinate how a title, piece of content, and related actions should be laid out in relation to 
each other.

Understanding [Grid](/components/grid) is the key to creating successful content layouts.

## Responsive Design

Layouts should be adaptable to different screen sizes. Our goal as designers and 
developers at HPE should be to create optimal and accessible user experiences regardless 
of screen size or resolution.

### Breakpoints

A breakpoint is a point at which some change in the page design is likely to occur.

For designers, breakpoints can help stress test and validate UX decisions around page 
layouts.

See the table below for breakpoints defined by the HPE Design System. Keep in mind that 
these breakpoints are not meant to target every single existing device &mdash; we understand 
that technology is ever evolving. Instead, the ranges defined here help build a strong 
foundation to account for diverse use cases when creating responsive designs.

| Breakpoint     | Range (width in pixels)
| -------------- | -----------------------
| **xsmall**     | 576 and below
| **small**      | 577 - 768
| **medium**     | 769 - 1080
| **large**      | 1081 - 1439
| **xlarge**     | 1440 and above

### Prioritizing Content Needs

Focusing on content needs allows for optimal user experiences to be created. Thinking 
about which pieces of content a user will likely need and want to interact with first informs 
how the items on the page should be ordered.

Specifying layout content in this way will also ensure that it is interepreted 
appropriately by screen readers for visually impaired users.

The example below has content labeled by its priority. Resize your browser window and 
notice the content layout adjust, ensuring content is ordered as desired across window 
widths. 

<Example 
  showResponsiveControls={['fullScreen']}
  code={[
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/content-layouts/ResponsiveContentLayoutExample.js",

  // represent the example
  height="650px"
  width="100%"
  screenContainer={{ scale: 0.57 }}

  <ResponsiveContentLayoutExample />
</Example>

## Implementing Content Layouts
The following discusses three approaches for building responsive content layouts. All approaches 
may be mixed and matched as desired.
- [Container-driven](#container-driven-layouts)
- [Content-driven](#content-driven-layouts)
- [Nested grids](#nested-grids)

These approaches take full advantage of Grid's flexibility which provides designers and 
developers great control and ability to execute layouts regardless of the user's screen size. 
For greater detail about Grid's properties and key concepts visit [getting to know Grid](/components/grid#getting-to-know-grid). 

Additionally, a can't miss tool for designers is [Layout Templates in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/4rdBkUlHd5MCVq3hvUOXHd/Page-Layouts?node-id=2906%3A21283) 
which provides Grid-based layout templates for each [responsive breakpoint](#breakpoints) and [page layout kind](/templates/page-layouts#page-kinds).

### Container-Driven Layouts
Container-driven layouts drive the layout from the outside-in. They begin by defining 
regions in which the content will live, whether those regions are [fixed, flexible, or fluid](/components/grid#background), 
and how those regions are [prioritized](#prioritizing-content-needs) at each responsive breakpoint.

Container-driven layouts are useful for defining larger layouts, such as at the page level, 
but can be useful for defining smaller sub-regions as well. The best use of available screen 
real-estate can be achieved by combining a container-driven page layout with components 
such as Cards which have been built to have adaptive layouts themselves.

The following example takes a container-driven approach, implementing an app-catalog 
consisting of a filters region and a results region.

Key aspects to the approach are:
- At larger breakpoints, the content layout will be a two-column layout; a single column 
at smaller breakpoints.
- The filters region will be fixed-width when in a two-column layout and [flex-width](/components/grid#flexible-columns) 
when in a single column. The results region always uses a [fluid grid](/components/grid#fluid-grids).
- The filters region are prioritized over the results region because the filters are needed to control 
the results.

<Example
  showResponsiveControls={['fullScreen']}
  code={[
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/content-layouts/ContainerDrivenLayout/ContainerDrivenLayout.js",

  // height, width, and screenContainer.scale value chosen to best visually 
  // represent the example
  height="650px"
  width="100%"
  screenContainer={{ scale: 0.75 }}
>
  <ContainerDrivenLayout />
</Example>

### Content-Driven Layouts
Content-driven layouts are driven from the inside-out, allowing the container to respond 
and adapt to things like user entered content, like names. The layout is custom fit to 
the content it holds.

The content-driven approach is useful for layouts such as modal dialogs or side-drawer 
content within a layer, where the content should occupy the space it needs and not be 
awkwardly constrained by its layout container.

The following example takes a content-driven approach, implementing a modal dialog 
displaying content returned from a server with an unknown length.

### Nested Grids
When dealing with complex layouts, it is helpful to simplify them by thinking of them 
as nested grids. Any column or grid area may be a grid itself. 

<Example
  horizontalLayout
  code={[
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/content-layouts/NestedGrid.js",
  ]}
