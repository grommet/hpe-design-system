## Designing for Responsiveness

App layouts should be adaptable to different screen sizes depending on the user input. Our goal as designers and developers at HPE should be to create optimal and accessible user experiences regardless of screen size or resolution.

### Prioritizing Content Needs

Focusing on content needs can help us create better optimal user experiencesâ€“think about which piece of content a user is likely to interact with first and order items on the page accordingly.

Specifying layout content in this way will also ensure that it is interepreted appropriately by screen readers for visually impaired users.

<Example 
  showResponsiveControls={['fullScreen']}
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/content-layouts/ResponsiveContentLayoutExample.js"
  // height, width, and screenContainer.scale value chosen to best visually 
  // represent the example
  height="650px"
  width="100%"
  screenContainer={{ scale: 0.57 }}
>
  <ResponsiveContentLayoutExample />
</Example>

### Breakpoints

A breakpoint is a point at which some change in the page design is likely to occur.

For designers, breakpoints can help stress test and validate UX decisions around page layouts.

See the table below for breakpoints defined by the HPE Design System. Keep in mind that these breakpoints are not meant to target every single existing device &mdash; we understand that technology is ever evolving. Instead, the ranges defined here help build a strong foundation to account for diverse use cases when creating responsive designs.

| T-shirt Size   | Range         |  Margin (pixels) |
| -------------- | ----------    | -----------------:
| **xsmall**    | 576 and below |      12
| **small**     | 577 - 768     |      24
| **medium**      | 769 - 1080    |      24
| **large**     | 1081 - 1439   |      48
| **xlarge**      | 1440 and above|      48

#### Page Margin

Page margin is the left and right space between the main content of a page and the screen edge.
Based on the screen size, the page margin differs at each breakpoint.

<Example 
  caption="A diagram showing the margin area on a large and small screen." 
  plain 
  pad="small"
  previewWidth="large"
  height={{ min: 'small' }}
>
  <PageMarginAnatomy />
</Example>

Wider margins are better for larger screens, as they create more whitespace around the perimeter of the content. Smaller margins are appropriate for smaller screens, in order to maximize the available screen real estate.
