Content layouts may be applied across different levels of information hierarchy.
At a page template level, it can help with the layout of page sections. At an "organism" 
level, it can coordinate how a title, piece of content, and related actions should be 
laid out in relation to each other.

Understanding [Grid](/components/grid) is the key to creating successful content layouts.

## Responsive Design

Layouts should be adaptable to different screen sizes depending on the user input. 
Our goal as designers and developers at HPE should be to create optimal and accessible 
user experiences regardless of screen size or resolution.

### Breakpoints

A breakpoint is a point at which some change in the page design is likely to occur.

For designers, breakpoints can help stress test and validate UX decisions around page 
layouts.

See the table below for breakpoints defined by the HPE Design System. Keep in mind that 
these breakpoints are not meant to target every single existing device &mdash; we understand 
that technology is ever evolving. Instead, the ranges defined here help build a strong 
foundation to account for diverse use cases when creating responsive designs.

| Breakpoint     | Range (width in pixels)
| -------------- | -----------------------
| **xsmall**     | 576 and below
| **small**      | 577 - 768
| **medium**     | 769 - 1080
| **large**      | 1081 - 1439
| **xlarge**     | 1440 and above

### Prioritizing Content Needs

Focusing on content needs can help us create better optimal user experiencesâ€“think 
about which piece of content a user is likely to interact with first and order items 
on the page accordingly.

Specifying layout content in this way will also ensure that it is interepreted 
appropriately by screen readers for visually impaired users.

The example below has content labelled by its priority. Resize your browser window and 
notice the content layout adjust, ensuring content is ordered as desired across window 
widths. 

<Example 
  showResponsiveControls={['fullScreen']}
  code={[
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/content-layouts/ResponsiveContentLayoutExample.js",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/PageHeader/PageHeader.js",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/page-layouts/components/AppContainer.js",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/page-layouts/anatomy/components/ContentArea.js",
    ]}
  // height, width, and screenContainer.scale value chosen to best visually 
  // represent the example
  height="650px"
  width="100%"
  screenContainer={{ scale: 0.57 }}
>
  <ResponsiveContentLayoutExample />
</Example>

## Using Grid with Templates
HPE Design System uses a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox via Grommet's Grid and Box 
components. Grid's flexibility provides designers and developers great control and ability 
to execute layouts regardless of the user's screen size.

The following provides a helpful framework and approach for building content 
layouts with Grid. Visit [getting to know Grid](/components/grid#getting-to-know-grid) 
to learn more about its properties and key concepts.

### Columns
Columns along with rows help define a grid layout.
- Number of columns
- Column widths
  - static
  - percentage
  - flexible min-max
- Gap between columns

### Nested Grids
When dealing with complex layouts, it is helpful to simplify them by thinking of them 
as nested grids. Any column or grid area may be a grid itself. 

### Rows
The HPE Design System primarily relies on columns + nested grid thinking for defining 
grid layouts. This is a philisophical approach to aid clarity in thinking, clarity when 
communicating concepts, and serve as a common thinking pattern across designers and 
developers. 

That said, Grid allows for row definitions. Use rows if finer control is needed over 
the vertical rhythm of the page.
