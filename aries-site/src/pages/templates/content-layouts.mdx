Content layouts may be applied across different levels of information hierarchy. At a page
template level, it can help with the layout of page sections. At an page section level, it can
coordinate how a title, piece of content, and related actions should be laid out in relation to
each other.

Understanding [Grid](/components/grid) is the key to creating successful content layouts.

## Responsive design

Layouts should be adaptable to different screen sizes. Our goal as designers and
developers at HPE should be to create optimal and accessible user experiences regardless
of screen size or resolution.

### Breakpoints

A breakpoint is a point at which some change in the page design is likely to occur.

For designers, breakpoints can help stress test and validate UX decisions around page
layouts.

See the table below for breakpoints defined by the HPE Design System. Keep in mind that
these breakpoints are not meant to target every single existing device &mdash; we understand
that technology is ever evolving. Instead, the ranges defined here help build a strong
foundation to account for diverse use cases when creating responsive designs.

| Breakpoint | Range (width in pixels) |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| **xsmall** | 576 and below           |
| **small**  | 577 - 768               |
| **medium** | 769 - 1080              |
| **large**  | 1081 - 1439             |
| **xlarge** | 1440 and above          |

### Prioritizing content needs

Focusing on content needs allows for optimal user experiences to be created. Thinking
about which pieces of content a user will likely need and want to interact with first informs
how the items on the page should be ordered.

Specifying layout content in this way will also ensure that it is interepreted
appropriately by screen readers for visually impaired users.

The example below has content labeled by its priority. Resize your browser window and
notice the content layout adjust, ensuring content is ordered as desired across window
widths.

<Example
  showResponsiveControls={['fullScreen']}
  code={[
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/content-layouts/ResponsiveContentLayoutExample.js',

## Implementing content layouts

The following discusses three approaches for building responsive content layouts. All approaches
may be mixed and matched as desired.

- [Container-driven](#container-driven-layouts)
- [Content-driven](#content-driven-layouts)
- [Nested grids](#nested-grids)

These approaches take full advantage of Grid's flexibility which provides designers and
developers great control and ability to execute layouts regardless of the user's screen size.
For greater detail about Grid's properties and key concepts visit [getting to know Grid](/components/grid#getting-to-know-grid).

Additionally, a can't miss tool for designers is [Layout Templates in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/4rdBkUlHd5MCVq3hvUOXHd/Page-Layouts?node-id=2906%3A21283)
which provides Grid-based layout templates for each [responsive breakpoint](#breakpoints) and [page layout kind](/templates/page-layouts#page-kinds).

### Container-driven layouts

Container-driven layouts drive the layout from the outside-in. They begin by defining
regions in which the content will live, whether those regions are [fixed, flexible, or fluid](/components/grid#background),
and how those regions are [prioritized](#prioritizing-content-needs) at each responsive breakpoint.

Container-driven layouts are useful for defining larger layouts, such as at the page level,
but can be useful for defining smaller sub-regions as well. The best use of available screen
real-estate can be achieved by combining a container-driven page layout with components
such as Cards which have been built to have adaptive layouts themselves.

The following example takes a container-driven approach, implementing an app-catalog
consisting of a filters region and a results region.

Key aspects to the approach are:

- At larger breakpoints, the content layout will be a two-column layout; a single column
  at smaller breakpoints.
- The filters region will be fixed-width when in a two-column layout and [flex-width](/components/grid#flexible-columns)
  when in a single column. The results region always uses a [fluid grid](/components/grid#fluid-grids).
- The filters region are prioritized over the results region because the filters are needed to control
  the results.

<Example
  showResponsiveControls={['fullScreen']}
  code={[
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/content-layouts/ContainerDrivenLayout/ContainerDrivenLayout.js',
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/content-layouts/PageHeader/PageHeader.js',

    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/data/mockData/applications.json',
  ]}
  github="https://github.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/blob/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/content-layouts/ContainerDrivenLayout/ContainerDrivenLayout.js"
  // height, width, and screenContainer.scale value chosen to best visually
  // represent the example
  height="650px"
  width="100%"
  screenContainer={{ scale: 0.75 }}
>
  <ContainerDrivenLayout />
</Example>

### Content-driven layouts

Content-driven layouts are driven from the inside-out, allowing the container to respond
and adapt to things like user entered content, like names. The layout is custom fit to
the content it holds.

The content-driven approach is useful for layouts such as modal dialogs or side drawer
content within a layer, where the content should occupy the space it needs and not be
awkwardly constrained by its layout container.

The following example takes a content-driven approach, implementing a modal dialog
displaying content returned from a server with an unknown length.

<Example
  code={[
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/content-layouts/ContentDrivenLayout.js',
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/ModalDialog/ModalDialog.js',
  ]}
  github="https://github.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/blob/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/content-layouts/ContentDrivenLayout.js"
  showResponsiveControls={['fullScreen']}
  screenContainer
  height="650px"
  width="100%"
>
  <ContentDrivenLayout />
</Example>

### Nested grids

When dealing with complex layouts, it is helpful to simplify them by thinking of them
as nested grids. Any column or grid area may be a grid itself.

<Example
  code={[
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/content-layouts/NestedGrid.js',
  ]}
  github="https://github.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/blob/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/content-layouts/NestedGrid.js"
  caption="Diagram illustrating how Grids may be nested inside one another."
  width="100%"

  <NestedGrid />
</Example>
