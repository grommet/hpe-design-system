## When a User would Use
- Pages where the hierarchy isn't crucial to the user experience, and where browsing is encouraged. For example, [HPE.com](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html) which presents a wide variety of content and allows a visitor to choose their own journey, relevant to their needs.
- User flows where a global navigation bar is visible at all times. This allows a user quick access to any of the site's primary hubs.

An example of a music app where the playlist is the hub and a song is the spoke. From the song, a user 
can matrix navigate to the artist or album.

  pad="small"
  previewWidth="large"
  height={{ min: 'small' }}

  <DiagramPreview 
    src={{
      dark: "/templateImages/matrix-music-invert.svg",
      light: '/templateImages/matrix-music.svg'
    }} 
    alt="Diagram illustrating the matrix navigation in a music app." />
