Matrix Navigation lets the user determine their own path by
jumping into particular areas of the screen, in no specific order. 
This allows them to directly access content of their choosing,
without having to go up and back down to get there.

## When a User would Use
- Pages where the hierarchy isn't crucial to the user experience and where browsing is encouraged. For example, [HPE.com](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html) presents a wide variety of content and allows a visitor to choose their own journey, relevant to their needs.
- User flows where a global navigation bar is visible at all times. This allows a user quick access to any of the site's primary hubs.

### Example: Matrix Navigation within a Music App
The way a music application allows a user to choose their own journey is a great example where matrix navigation is employed. Songs, albums, artists, and playlists all interrelate, but are relevant to different users at different times.

Applying matrix navigation provides a user easy access to all related content at any given time. On a song screen, they may access the album the song appears on, the artist who performed it, and/or the playlists to which the song has been added. No matter the user's current need, matrix navigation provides easy access and choice.
