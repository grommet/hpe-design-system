## Use cases
### Providing inline contextual help

A Popover can be triggered through an icon-only button to offer helpful contextual information in a non-intrusive manner.

| **1** | **Title**     | Identifies the Popover.               | Optional |                                            |

## Content guidelines

Popovers should be:
- Relevant: It should relate to its trigger.
- Not crucial: It should not include crucial information or actions needed to complete a task.
- Short: It should be concise to avoid overwhelming the user and taking up excessive screen space. Follow [voice and tone](https://design-system.hpe.design/foundation/voice-and-tone) guidelines for writing effective content.

Recommended practices:
- Use `Paragraph/Small` and `Anchor/Small` to save space.
- Avoid using titles if they do not provide additional context.
- Use `Text` for the title instead of a heading.

## Accessibility

Ensure accessibility by including an `a11yTitle` on:
- Triggers without labels, such as icon-only buttons.
- The Close button, describing the Popover's contents.

Add `aria-haspopup` as well as `aria-controls` on:
- The trigger in which opens the popover.

   - `aria-haspopup` tells users that there is a pop-up associated with the element.
   - `aria-controls` gives users more detailed information about which specific element will be affected when they interact with the element that has aria-haspopup.

| Key   | Interaction                                                                                                      |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tab** | Highlights interactive elements. Focus remains within the Popover until it is closed. Once exited, focus returns to the trigger. |
| **Esc** | Exits the Popover at any time.                                                                                   |
