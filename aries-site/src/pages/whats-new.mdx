# What's New

Track Design System announcements, new template patterns, guidance, and released components.

Our [roadmap](https://roadmap.grommet.io/hpe-design-system-roadmap-mike-walrath-hpe-com) provides 
an idea for what is on the horizon. Our [backlog](https://github.com/orgs/grommet/projects/10) 
provides greater detail about what is being worked on. Please share any feedback you may have 
regarding either via [Slack](https://hpe.slack.com/archives/C04LMJWQT).

### NEW NameValueList
- Looking to display key-value pairs cleanly, consistently, and semantically correct? NEW 
[NameValueList component](https://v2.grommet.io/namevaluelist) is now available on Grommet. 
[HPE theming and guidance](https://github.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/issues/1986) will follow soon.

### Stay current with the latest guidance
- How should card elevation be handled? What should I do if my card has multiple interactive elements? 
Can cards have multiple interactive elements? View the new [Card interactions guidance](/components/card#interactions) 
and updated card example implementations. 
- Guidance for required and optional fields has been refined. Read the 
[updated guidance](/templates/forms#required-vs-optional-fields) and 
[research](https://www.figma.com/file/3fkwBelW5UsCbfwdDCJkT8/HPE-Form-Templates?node-id=5236%3A11011).

### "Big Things" progress updates
Here are the latest developments regarding roadmap items:
- **NameValueList**. [See above](/whats-new#namevaluelist).
- **Page Layouts**. Page layout executions and use cases have been collected across teams and synthesized to 
[identify common templates](https://github.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/issues/1912). Creation of dashboard 
templates will be prioritized, followed by wizards, lists, and tables.
- **Tags**. Or, are they labels? Custom attributes? Chips? Jury says... tags! A special thanks to Greg Furuiye 
for his contributions to tag research, explorations, ideations, and initial guidance &mdash; contributions 
help a ton! Next steps are to assemble guidance and examples for the Design System site. Plus, development 
on the supporting Grommet Tag component has begun.
