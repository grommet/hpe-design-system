# What's New

Track Design System announcements, new template patterns, guidance, and released components.

Our [roadmap](https://roadmap.grommet.io/hpe-design-system-roadmap-mike-walrath-hpe-com) provides 
an idea for what is on the horizon. Our [backlog](https://github.com/orgs/grommet/projects/10) 
provides greater detail about what is being worked on. Please give feedback you may have on 
either via [Slack](https://hpe.slack.com/archives/C04LMJWQT).

## January 10-16, 2021

### Headings

- Headings in the Figma library have been updated to use `text-strong`.
- TODO: Apply `text-strong` as default in HPE Theme.

### Background colors

- Published a new page providing guidance for 
[how to apply background colors](https://design-system.hpe.design/foundation/background-colors-guidance) 
in your application layout. We've already received great feedback and identified areas which need 
to be addressed.

### Anchor

- Added an example for an [Anchor with weight](/components/anchor#anchor-with-weight) to the Anchor page.

### Pagination

- Added custom theming capabilities for the proposed Pagination Grommet component. [Play with Pagination behavior](https://deploy-preview-4646--sad-tereshkova-173d07.netlify.app/?path=/story/controls-pagination--custom) 
and/or [follow the pull request progress](https://github.com/grommet/grommet/pull/4646).

### Miscellaneous

## January 3-9, 2021

### Headings

- Decision has been made to make `text-strong` <ColorSwatch background="text-strong" /> the 
default font color for Headings. Previously, Headings defaulted to color `text` 
<ColorSwatch background="text" />.

### Pagination

- Made pagination controls respect a uniform width for the proposed Pagination Grommet component.
- Added abillity to control the sizing of pagination controls via "t-shirt sizing."
- Explored approaches for allowing custom theming capabilities.
- [Play with Pagination behavior](https://deploy-preview-4646--sad-tereshkova-173d07.netlify.app/?path=/story/controls-pagination--custom) 
and/or [follow the pull request progress](https://github.com/grommet/grommet/pull/4646).

### Searching & Filtering

- Additional guidance was requested for how the text should read in a situation after 
a user has filtered a set of table results and selected rows from the filtered table. 
That work is represented in [this issue](https://github.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/issues/1343).

### Miscellaneous

- [Fixed order of plot points](https://github.com/grommet/grommet/issues/4854) in Chart.
- Enhanced Layer to allow elevation to be [controlled via theme](https://github.com/grommet/grommet/pull/4851), 
and [set default elevation](https://github.com/grommet/grommet-theme-hpe/pull/150) of 'large' in HPE Theme.
- Made casing of form validation errors consistent across [Form examples](https://design-system.hpe.design/templates/forms).
