### Headings

- Headings in the Figma library have been updated to use `text-strong`.
- TODO: Apply `text-strong` as default in HPE Theme.

### Background colors

- Published a new page providing guidance for 
[how to apply background colors](https://design-system.hpe.design/foundation/background-colors-guidance) 
in your application layout. We've already received great feedback and identified areas which need 
to be addressed. The discussion and feedback is highly valued. Please keep it coming and 
[share your thoughts](https://hpe.slack.com/archives/C04LMJWQT/p1610579439277200).

### Anchor

- Added an example for an [Anchor with weight](/components/anchor#anchor-with-weight) to the Anchor page.

### Pagination

- Added custom theming capabilities for the proposed Pagination Grommet component. [Play with Pagination behavior](https://deploy-preview-4646--sad-tereshkova-173d07.netlify.app/?path=/story/controls-pagination--custom) 
and/or [follow the pull request progress](https://github.com/grommet/grommet/pull/4646).

### Miscellaneous

### Headings

- Decision has been made to make `text-strong` <ColorSwatch background="text-strong" /> the 
default font color for Headings. Previously, Headings defaulted to color `text` 
<ColorSwatch background="text" />.

### Pagination

- 

### Searching & Filtering

- Additional guidance was requested for how the text should read in a situation after 
a user has filtered a set of table results and selected rows from the filtered table. 
That work is represented in [this issue](https://github.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/issues/1343).
