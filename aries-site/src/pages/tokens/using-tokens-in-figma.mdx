In Figma, design tokens are stored as variables and styles. They are used by applying these to properties in a file.

Use these Figma guides to [learn more about Figma variables](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15339657135383-Guide-to-variables-in-Figma) and [how to apply variables to designs](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15343107263511-Apply-variables-to-designs).

## Enable HPE Design Tokens library

Variables and styles should be available by default, but if not, make sure the HPE Design Tokens library is enabled on your design file.

See the [Figma guide on using libraries](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041051154-Guide-to-libraries-in-Figma), and read more about HPE Design token libraries below.

## Add design tokens to Figma designs

To use HPE design tokens in Figma as a product designer, youâ€™ll need to enable ("Add to file") the ["Design tokens - Semantic" library]() in your design files.

These tokens are intended to be used generically across use cases and cover the following categories:

- Typography
- Color
- Elevation
- Spacing
- Size
- Radius
- Border width (currently not supported by Figma)
