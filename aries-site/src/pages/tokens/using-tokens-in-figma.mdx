In Figma, design tokens are stored as variables and styles. They are used by applying these to properties in a file.

Use these Figma guides to [learn more about Figma variables](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15339657135383-Guide-to-variables-in-Figma) and [how to apply variables to designs](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15343107263511-Apply-variables-to-designs).

## Add design tokens to Figma designs

To use HPE design tokens in Figma as a product designer, youâ€™ll need to enable ("Add to file") the ['Design tokens - Semantic'](https://www.figma.com/design/vH5MOEoXU5Kv7qWvBqiUC2/Design-Tokens---Semantic?node-id=0-1&t=49Ozw7ivhg8310Cv-1) library in your design files. See the [Figma guide on using libraries](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041051154-Guide-to-libraries-in-Figma) if needed. These tokens are intended to be used generically across use cases and cover the following categories:

As variables:

- Color
- Spacing
- Size
- Radius
- BorderWidth (currently not supported by Figma)

As styles:

- Typography
- Elevation

## Semantic token types in Figma

## Variable scoping

We have scoped variables only to the properties they apply to. For example, in Figma, border colour tokens (e.g. color.border.default) can only be applied to strokes and borderRadius tokens (e.g. radius.small) can only be applied to corner radius in Figma. This should make it easier to find and apply tokens in Figma.
