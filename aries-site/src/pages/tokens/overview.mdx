## What is a design token?

Design tokens codify the design decisions that make up a design system's visual style. Tokens replace hard-coded values, such as hex codes for color or px values for spacing, with clear names.

Tokens can represent values including but not limited to colors, typography, spacing, and motion.

An HPE Design Token consists of two main parts:

1. A self-documenting name that represents the coded value: â€œhpe.color.brand".
1. An associated value: #01A982.

Additionally, a design token can have these optional properties:

1. Type: A category for the token's value (e.g., color, dimension, shadow).
1. Description: Concise text to describe how the token should be used.

TO DO: Add visual

## Why are design tokens important?

Design tokens establish a source of truth for HPE's visual style in a tech-agnostic format, enabling a truly consistent, unified experience across applications.

Token names are purpose-driven, rather than hard-coded values, which provides the flexibility for token values to evolve over time with our visual style. When tokens are implemented across design and development, style updates will propagate consistently across applications simply by pulling in the latest version of the tokens.

Design tokens allow us to:

- Codify design decisions
- Enable teams across various tech stacks to build efficiently and consistenly with the HPE Design System
- Replaces manual maintenance methods with faster automated processes that keep design and dev sychronized
- Build a shared language across design and development

## Types of tokens

Our tokens can be grouped into 3 levels: primitive, semantic, and component. The naming and intended use of a token get more specific as you move from the primitive to semantic to component level. This tiered system of tokens exists to enhance token consumption, management, and maintenance.

### Primitive tokens

Primitive tokens define the most foundational level of the token system, establishing fundamental attributes like color and dimension.

The value of a primitive token will always be a CSS value such as a hex code, px, or rem value. Typically, primitive token names describe the token value and not where it should be applied.

Primitive design tokens should not be used directly. They exist to provide the foundational options and be referenced in semantic and component design tokens.

<Example height={{ min: 'xsmall' }}>
  <Box align="center" direction="row" gap="small">
    <Box background="brand" pad="medium" round="small" flex={false} />
    <Text size="large">hpe.green.600</Text>
  </Box>
</Example>

### Semantic tokens

Semantic tokens apply a specific meaning to a primitive token to establish how and when a style should be applied. Semantic tokens capture design decisions for color, spacing, elevation, typography, and more.

The value of a semantic token can either be a reference to a primitive token or another semantic token.

Semantic tokens can have different values in different contexts. For example, the value of `hpe.color.background.back` might differ for light vs dark mode. Similarly, the value of `hpe.spacing.large` might differ for wide vs narrow viewports. By building with semantic tokens, the values can flex based on the context.

<Example height={{ min: 'xsmall' }}>
  <Box align="center" direction="row" gap="small">
    <Box background="brand" pad="medium" round="small" flex={false} />
    <Text size="large">hpe.background.primary.default</Text>
  </Box>
</Example>

### Component tokens

Component tokens capture specific design decisions for an individual component (such as button) or family of related components (such as inputs).

The value of a component token can either be a reference to a primitive token, semantic token, or another component token.

<Example height={{ min: 'xsmall' }}>
  <Box align="center" direction="row" gap="small">
    <Box background="brand" pad="medium" round="small" flex={false} />
    <Text size="large">hpe.button.primary.enabled.background</Text>
  </Box>
</Example>
