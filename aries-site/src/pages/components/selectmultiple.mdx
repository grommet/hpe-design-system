The SelectMultiple component is typically used as a form element but can also be leveraged for user experiences that include searching or narrowing down data. It contains an optional search field. When within a form, the SelectMultiple will support labels, error and disabled states.

## When to use

When multiple selections can be made in a list that contains 5 or more items.

## When not to use

- For lists that contain less than 5 options to choose from, consider using a [CheckBoxGroup](/components/checkboxgroup) instead. 
- When only a single selection is permitted, use the [Select](/components/select) component instead.

1. **Select**: Displays current input value and control to open/close options drop.
1. **Selection Summary**: Succinct presentation of what a user can do, has done, and/or reset to default state.
1. **Search (optional)**: Helps narrow down or quickly find options corresponding to the entered keyword.
1. **Help Text (optional)**
1. **List**: Available options from which the user can choose
1. **List Item**: Clearly displays available option and its selected state.

## Sizing & Scrolling

- Depending on the length of the dropdown list, the height of the SelectMultiple can be increased or decreased as needed with the `dropHeight` prop.
- For lists with more than 10 items, consider setting a max height to ensure optimum readability and scannability of list items. 
- It is recommended to show approximately 10-15 items before enabling a scroll. Showing more than that will potentially increase the cognitive load on the user.

## Best Practices

- Always use a label unless there is something else (such as preceding body text or headers) that makes that SelectMultipleâ€™s purpose perfectly clear.
- Ordering of lists - chronological/recency
- Search: Consider including a search if your list is 10 items or longer to make it easier to browse options.
