## Guidance

Layer is used to define the properties and behaviors of an overlay for things like a modal dialog or notification. The content of the Layer is defined by the Box component.

### Create

- Define the container, content, location, and any animation, depending on the intent of the use case (like a notification or modal with a form).
- Use the [Box](/components/box) component to define the content of your layer.
- Ensure that any next steps for the user are provided to progress or close out of the layer.

### Best Practices

- Modal is best applied when you need to center attention on specific content, a task, or behavior and not allow interactivity with the underlying content.
- Position forms to the right (side-drawer).
- Positioning of notification layers depends on the notification's context. Please refer to [notification guidance](/components/notification) for more detail.
- Layer is not great for navigation as it 'hides' content. Maintain context for the user with layer.
- Provide an alternative to move out of the Layer by allowing use of the 'esc' key. This applies to all Layers, regardless of type (e.g. [informational](/components/layer#informational) or [actionable](/components/layer#actionable)).

### Using Headings in Layer

Layer headings should be semantically correct. Treat a Layer as if it were a stand alone page, with the exception that the first heading within a Layer should be an `h2` or `<Heading level={2} />`. All subsequent headings should follow typical [semantic heading structure](/foundation/typography#semantic-usage-of-heading-levels).

### Accessibility

When using a Layer with `modal={false}`, it is critical that the focus is moved to the "Close" button inside the Layer. This close button should also be given an `a11yTitle` that provides the user with context that they are in a Layer.

For example, implementation of this "Close" button for a Layer would be:

```
<Button 
  a11yTitle={`You are in a layer containing a form to add new hosts. 
  To close this layer, press Enter.`}
  icon={<FormClose />} 
  onClick={() => setShowLayer(false)}
  autoFocus
/>
```

## Types 

Depending on the content displayed, layers may be thought of as either [informational](components/layer#informational) or [actionable](components/layer#actionable). This distinction is important as it affects whether the page content adjacent to the Layer should be interactive as well as how a user may close the Layer.

### Informational

Used purely to inform users of status or state. These are text-only with no required or optional actions. These may be [dialog modals](/components/layer#center-modal), [toast notifications](/templates/toast-notifications), etc.

Informational Layers contain the following elements and interactions:
- A sole ["X" icon](https://icons.grommet.io/?s=formclose) for the user to close out of the Layer. Additional elements, such as a close button, cause further clutter and confusion for the user.
- For all layers that are opened as a result of a user clicking an element on a page, the Layer can be closed by clicking outside of its content.
- For system-generated layers such as [Toast Notifications](/templates/toast-notifications), the Layer cannot be closed by clicking outside of its content and instead must be dismissed by clicking the "X icon" in the Layer.

### Actionable

Provides users with any type of action, required or optional. These can be confirmations, filters, forms, etc.

Actionable Layers contain the following elements and interactions: 
- A cancel or close button will always be positioned within the footer of the Layer. Note that the "X" icon is omitted to avoid any confusion the user may have on which option they should use to close out the Layer. 
- The Layer heading and action buttons should be sticky while the rest of the Layer content is scrollable.
Provides users with any type of action, required or optional. These can be confirmations, filters, forms, etc.
- Buttons within side drawers (forms, filters, etc.) should always be **left-aligned**.
- Buttons within wizards, confirmation modals, dialogs, and notifications should always be **right-aligned**.
- To prevent the user from losing progress due to accidentally misclicking outside of a layer, a layer should not be closable by clicking outside of its content. Instead, users should be consciously clicking on a button to close out of the layer to abort any and all actions.

**Keep in mind that all layers can be alternatively be closed out of at any time by hitting the "esc" key.** 

## Variants

Depending on the use case of a Layer, the placement and layout of content may differ. Here are some common use cases and guidelines for various types of Layers.

### Side Drawer Modal

A Side Drawer layer is anchored to one side of the screen and acts as a modal. This means that while the layer is open, the rest of the page cannot be interacted with. When a layer contains a [Form](/templates/forms), it should be anchored to the right side of the screen.

<Example
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/layer?theme=hpe#props"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/layer/LayerSideDrawerExample.js"
  height={{ min: 'small' }}
>
  <LayerSideDrawerExample />
</Example>

### Center Modal

A center modal is anchored at the center of the window and acts as a modal. This means that while the layer is open, the rest of the page cannot be interacted with. Center modals may be used to display information without leaving the current context.

  height={{ min: 'small' }}
