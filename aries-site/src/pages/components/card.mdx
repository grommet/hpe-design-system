## Principles

Cards are containers that display content and actions on a single topic. They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information.

**Contained**

A card is identifiable as a single, contained unit.

**Independent**

A card can stand alone, without relying on surrounding elements for context.

**Individual**

A card cannot merge with another card, or divide into multiple cards.

**Summarized**

A card by nature has limited real-estate, so it should present summarized information.

## When to use

- When presenting high-level, summarized pieces of information.
- When presenting an item or collection of items that can best be consumed visually.

## When not to use

- Do not use a Card as a clickable region to filter data on the same screen.
- Do not use a Card to group complex content into a single container.
- When data attributes across items needs to be analyzed, sorted, compared and filtered, a Card may not be the best tool. Instead, [DataTable](/components/datatable) may be more appropriate.

## Types of cards

### Call-to-action

**Primary purpose:** A call-to-action card should be used to entice the user down a desired path.

#### Example use cases

- Request a trial
- Register for an event
- Launch a demo for an upcoming feature release
- Upgrade software version
  - This encourages users to stay on the latest version to avoid bugs, legacy software.

This type of card is more commonly used within marketing contexts and should be used sparingly within HPE products and services. Secondary purposes might include an action to navigate to a screen with greater detail on the offering.

#### Anatomy

Use the elements below to craft the appropriate amount of visual emphasis for the card's use case. See the call-to-action card examples for best practices.

DIAGRAM TO BE ADDED

1. **Card identifier**: This region is intended to provide the user with context on what the card is about.
   - a. **Title (required):** For Call-to-action cards, this should be a unique, enticing headline to capture the user's attention.
   - b. **Pretitle (optional):** Additional context for what this call-to-action is about (e.g., "Virtual Event").
   - c. **Subtitle (optional):** Any concise, additional supportive text to help establish the card's identity and context.
1. **Actions (required):** Card-level actions.
   - A CTA, primary, or solid-filled button labelled with the main call-to-action is required. At times, additional supporting actions/links may be appropriate.
1. **Description (optional):** A short paragraph that elaborates on the card's purpose.
1. **Image/Media (optional):** An eye-catching, brand-approved image that grabs the user's attention. Use of this area should be reserved for highly promotional cards like events and feature announcements.
1. **Background (optional):** A background color or brand-approved texture/gradient.
   - When using a texture or gradient, be mindful to maintain appropriate color contrast between the card's text and the background.

#### Presentation

- Call-to-action cards may be presented in a group with other call-to-action cards but also may be presented on their own.
- When presented in a group, their layout/treatment can be independent from the layout/treatment of the surrounding call-to-action cards.

- Cards that are highly promotional should use elements that create higher visual emphasis (colorful brand-approved images, background colors/textures, etc.).
  - Use cases (ordered from highest visual emphasis to lowest) include event promotion, new feature release, trial promotion.
- Cards that are less promotional should still have enticing titles but do not necessarily need as strong of visual emphasis. The white brand-approved textures are appropriate if a subtle visual emphasis is desired.
  - A use case is a software upgrade announcement.

#### Examples

These are example layouts for various use cases. Call-to-action ards that are highly promotional, such as event promotions, incorporate stronger visual elements while those that are less promotional, like software updates, are more subtle.

### Navigational

**Primary purpose:** Navigational cards provide the user with a means of wayfinding.

Navigational cards enable the user to identify, compare, and choose their desired next step.

#### Anatomy

Use the elements below to craft the appropriate amount of visual emphasis for the card's use case. See the call-to-action card examples for best practices.

DIAGRAM TO BE ADDED

1. **Card identifier**: This region is intended to provide the user with context on what the card is about.
   - a. **Title (required):** For navigational cards, this should be the name of the page the user will be navigated to.
   - b. **Icon/Avatar (optional):** A unique icon/avatar that assists the user in identifying their desired navigational path.
1. **Action (required):** If there is a single action on the card, the entire card should be clickable. If the entire card is clickable, a visual of a button in not required in the card.
1. **Description (optional):** A short paragraph that elaborates on the destination of the card.

#### Presentation

- Present navigational cards in a group with other navigational cards of the same category.
  - For example, a group of navigational cards may be used to provide a user with a means of navigating from a hub called “Manage” to various spoke pages such as “Roles and Permissions”, “Account Settings”, etc.
- Use the same anatomy and layout as other navigational cards in the same group.
  - This visual consistency further establishes the relationship that these cards are part of the same category.

#### Examples

These are example layouts for various use cases.

</Box>

## Formatting

### Alignment

Use left-alignment whenever possible in order to optimize readability.

<BestPracticeGroup>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message: 'Left-align text and content.',
    }}
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardAlignmentBestPractice />
  </Example>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don't center text and content. This hurts readability.`,
    }}
    width="100%"
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardAlignmentBestPractice bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

### Spacing

For cards within the same layout section, place a minimum gap of "medium" between cards.

<BestPracticeGroup columns="100%">
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message: 'Use a "medium" gap between cards.',
    }}
    width="100%"
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardSpacingBestPractice />
  </Example>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don't use a gap smaller than "medium" between cards because this creates a crowded feeling.`,
    }}
    width="100%"
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardSpacingBestPractice bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

## Interactions

### Mouse

- If a card does not contain an action behavior, do not provide hover feedback.
- If a card has a singular action behavior, the entire card can be clickable. Provide a hand cursor change and large elevation on hover.
- If a card contains a multiple action behaviors, such as a primary action and a secondary action, provide the documented hover feedback on the individual actionable elements only.

### Keyboard

| Key         | Interaction                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tab         | Move forward through the cards (if entire card is clickable) or through logical order of the interactive elements.    |
| Shift + Tab | Move backward through the cards (if entire card is clickable) or through logical order of the interactive elements.   |
| Enter       | Perform the card action (if entire card is clickable) or the corresponding action of the focused interactive element. |

## Accessibility

Card titles should use a Heading of the correct [semantic heading level](foundation/typography#semantic-usage-of-heading-levels) based on where the card is in the document. For example, a card nested under a Heading level 2 should use a Heading level 3 for its title.

Don't use Text for the card title as this will hurt the experience for users of assisstive technologies.
