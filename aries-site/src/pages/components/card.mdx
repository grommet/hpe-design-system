Elements of a card can include titles, subheadings, charts, media, metadata, and notifications. They are flexible and customizable to organize your content.

## What makes up a Card?

### Purpose

- Allows the user to quickly scan and determine if they should engage further
- Focused and concise information of a single subject
- Primarily limited to a singular action (like a large button)
- Secondary actions (e.g. clickable icons, anchors, buttons) should be clearly 
distiguishable. When applying these use cases, the card no longer should behave as a primary action.

### Form

- Aligns to the grid and global edge size for gap, margin, and pad
- Shape and direction may be horizontal or vertical
- Can include a footer for additional information
- Customizable background, border, and elevation

### Content
- Provides a summary preview of information to scan and process
- Visually group content or distinguish various types of information
- Organize in a responsive grid or list

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-design/design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/card/CardAnatomy.js"

## When to Use

- When presenting a collection of high-level pieces of information (e.g. dashboard)
- When presenting a menu of options (e.g. a catalog of available services)
- Best for sets of items which can best be consumed visually

### Dashboard Example
Cards may be customized to meet the needs of the content they contain.
In a dashboard, content is organized and displayed for the user to quickly 
scan and identify areas which may need for further engagement.

Each card is customizable and clickable (like a large button) allowing users to explore 
the detail behind the summarized content.

### Navigation Example

A grid of cards can provide a simple set of easy to navigate items. In this example, 
the cards are a uniform, homogenous collection of services, which can be browsed
and easily digested. A click on card leads to that service's view and allow the user
to explore further.

## Guidelines

### General

- Limit content to under 100 characters or no more than two short sentences
- Provide a visual hierchy to content
- Only one idea or subject in one card
- Differentiate the card from its background using color, border, shadow, or contrast

### Actions

- The card typically behaves as a singular action item (like a big button)
- Secondary actions should be differentiated visually and behaviorally
- Do not include inline links/anchors.

### Grid, List, or Table?

- Grid is great for dashboards or when the use case for the cards lend themselves 
to larger sizes and simple scanning (e.g. service catalog)
- A list of cards is great when you need to display more cards that have simple 
content but have serveral items (a list of users).
- Consider using list alone, without the card component, when actions required for 
items are more complex (like multi-select)
- When content needs to be analyzed, sorted, compared and filtered, a table may 
be more appropriate.

## More Examples of a Card

### Simple Card

Consider a small, simple card for smaller data sets that can be scanned easily in a list.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-design/design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/card/SimpleCard.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/card?theme=hpe#props"
>
  <SimpleCard />
</Example>

### Card with a Footer

Adding footer content can help provide additional information that can provide more context, clarity, or display notification data.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-design/design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/card/CardWithFooter.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/card?theme=hpe#props"
  background="background-back"
>
  <CardWithFooter />
</Example>

### Card with an Image

When images are featured on cards, they have a full ‘bleed’ as well as heirachical text to give additional context for the content.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-design/design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/card/CardWithImage.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/card?theme=hpe#props"
>
  <CardWithImage />
</Example>

### Card as a Dashboard Element

Card's versatility allows for it to serve dashboard contexts quite nicely. The main content can 
showcase a key performance indicator and be represented by a wide variety of charts or meters. Ideally the 
key performance indicator is accompanied by a contextual signal, indicating whether a user should 
drill into the detail behind the metric's current value.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-design/design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/card/CardMeterExample.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/card?theme=hpe#props"
>
  <CardMeterExample />
