## Principles

Cards are containers that display content and actions on a single topic. They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information.

**Contained**

A card is identifiable as a single, contained unit.

**Independent**

A card can stand alone, without relying on surrounding elements for context.

**Individual**

A card cannot merge with another card, or divide into multiple cards.

**Summarized**

A card by nature has limited real-estate, so it should present summarized information.

## Types of cards

### Call-to-action

**Primary purpose:** A call-to-action card should be used to entice the user down a desired path.

#### Example use cases

- Request a trial
- Register for an event
- Upgrade software version
  - This encourages users to stay on the latest version to avoid bugs, legacy software.

This type of card is more commonly used within marketing contexts and should be used sparingly within HPE products and services. Secondary purposes might include an action to navigate to a screen with greater detail on the offering.

<Example
  componentName="Card"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/card/CardExample.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/card?theme=hpe#props"

  horizontalLayout
>
  <CallToActionCard />
</Example>

#### Anatomy

Call-to-action cards should be visually prominent as a means of attracting user attention.

TBD

#### Presentation

- Call-to-action cards may be presented in a group with other call-to-action cards but also may be presented on their own.
- When presented in a group, their layout/treatment can be independent from the layout/treatment of the surrounding call-to-action cards.

### Navigational

**Primary purpose:** Navigational cards provide the user with a means of wayfinding.

Navigational cards enable the user to identify, compare, and choose their desired next step.

<Example
  componentName="Card"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/card/CardExample.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/card?theme=hpe#props"
  figma="https://www.figma.com/file/je5AYzMavRt1cG7rmw8j1W/HPE-Card-Component?node-id=1%3A2"
  grommetSource="https://github.com/grommet/grommet/blob/master/src/js/components/Card/Card.js"
  width="100%"
>
  <NavigationalCard />
</Example>

#### Anatomy

TBD

#### Presentation

- Present navigational cards in a group with other navigational cards of the same category.
  - For example, a group of navigational cards may be used to provide a user with a means of navigating from a hub called “Manage” to various spoke pages such as “Roles and Permissions”, “Account Settings”, etc.
- Use the same anatomy and layout as other navigational cards in the same group.
  - This visual consistency further establishes the relationship that these cards are part of the same category.

## Formatting

### Alignment

Use left alignment whenever possible in order to optimize readability.

<BestPracticeGroup>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message: 'Left-align text and content.',
    }}
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardAlignmentBestPractice />
  </Example>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don't center text and content. This hurts readability.`,
    }}
    width="100%"
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardAlignmentBestPractice bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

TBD - when can an action button take the full-width of the card? When width is less than medium?

### Spacing

Place a minimum gap of "medium" between cards. For cards within the same section, a "medium" gap should be used. For cards in adjacent layout sections, a "large" gap may be used (TBD - clarify this and or show a do/dont)

<BestPracticeGroup columns="100%">
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message: 'Use a "medium" gap between cards.',
    }}
    width="100%"
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardSpacingBestPractice />
  </Example>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don't use a gap smaller than "medium" between cards because this creates a crowded feeling.`,
    }}
    width="100%"
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardSpacingBestPractice bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

## Interactions

### Mouse

- If a card does not contain an action behavior, do not provide hover feedback.
- If a card has a singular action behavior, the entire card can be clickable. Provide a hand cursor change and large elevation on hover.
- If a card contains a multiple action behaviors, such as a primary action and a secondary action, provide the documented hover feedback on the individual actionable elements only.

### Keyboard

| Key         | Interaction                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tab         | Move forward through the cards (if entire card is clickable) or through logical order of the interactive elements.    |
| Shift + Tab | Move backward through the cards (if entire card is clickable) or through logical order of the interactive elements.   |
| Enter       | Perform the card action (if entire card is clickable) or the corresponding action of the focused interactive element. |

## Accessibility

Card titles should use a Heading of the correct semantic level based on where the card is in the document. For example, a card nested under a Heading level 2 should use a Heading level 3 for its title.

Don't use Text for the card title as this will hurt the experience for users of assisstive technologies.
