## Principles

Cards are containers that display content and actions on a single topic. They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information.

**Contained**

A card is identifiable as a single, contained unit.

**Independent**

A card can stand alone, without relying on surrounding elements for context.

**Individual**

A card cannot merge with another card, or divide into multiple cards.

**Summarized**

A card by nature has limited real-estate, so it should present summarized information.

## Types of cards

### Call-to-action

A call-to-action (CTA) card should be used to entice the user down a desired path. CTA cards should be visually prominent as a means of attracting user attention. This type of card is more commonly used within marketing contexts and should be used sparingly within HPE products and services.

Examples use cases for a CTA card include:

- Request a trial
- Register for an event
- Upgrade software version
- This encourages users to stay on the latest version to avoid bugs, legacy software

TO DO: add more common examples

<Example
  componentName="Card"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/card/CardExample.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/card?theme=hpe#props"
  figma="https://www.figma.com/file/je5AYzMavRt1cG7rmw8j1W/HPE-Card-Component?node-id=1%3A2"
  grommetSource="https://github.com/grommet/grommet/blob/master/src/js/components/Card/Card.js"
  plain
  horizontalLayout
>
  <CallToActionCard />
</Example>

In order to create visual prominence, CTA cards should include one or more of the following elements:

- CTA button
- Brand approved background texture/gradient
- Graphic/Image

DO/DONT (probably no image + background texture)

Call-to-action cards may be presented in a group with other call-to-action cards but also may be presented on their own. When presented in a group, their layout/treatment can be independent from the layout/treatment of the surrounding call-to-action cards.

### Navigational

Navigational cards provide the user with a means of wayfinding. Navigational cards enable the user to identify, compare, and choose their desired next step.

Navigational cards should:

- Be presented in a group with other navigational cards of the same category.
- Provide an easily scannable and browseable range of options.
- Have the same anatomy and layout as other navigational cards in their group.
  - This visual consistency further establishes the sense that these cards are part of the same category.

<Example
  componentName="Card"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/card/CardExample.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/card?theme=hpe#props"
  figma="https://www.figma.com/file/je5AYzMavRt1cG7rmw8j1W/HPE-Card-Component?node-id=1%3A2"
  grommetSource="https://github.com/grommet/grommet/blob/master/src/js/components/Card/Card.js"
  width="100%"
>
  <NavigationalCard />
</Example>

For example, a group of cards may be used to provide a user with a means of navigating from a hub called “Manage” to various spoke pages such as “Roles and Permissions”, “Account Settings”, etc. All the cards in this group should be related to “Manage”.

## Formatting

### Anatomy

TBD

- Background (use sparingly, often only in CTA cards)
- Graphic/Icon/Visual (use sparingly, only if it provides unqiue identification)
- Pre-title
- Title (required)
- Subtitle
- Description
- Action

### Alignment

Use left alignment whenever possible in order to optimize readability.

<BestPracticeGroup>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message: 'Left-align text and content.',
    }}
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardAlignmentBestPractice />
  </Example>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don't center text and content. This hurts readability.`,
    }}
    width="100%"
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardAlignmentBestPractice bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

TBD - when can an action button take the full-width of the card? When width is < medium?

### Spacing

Place a minimum gap of "medium" between cards. For cards within the same section, a "medium" gap should be used. For cards in adjacent layout sections, a "large" gap may be used (TBD - clarify this and or show a do/dont)

<BestPracticeGroup columns="100%">
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message: 'Use a "medium" gap between cards.',
    }}
    width="100%"
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardSpacingBestPractice />
  </Example>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don't use a gap smaller than "medium" between cards because this creates a crowded feeling.`,
    }}
    width="100%"
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardSpacingBestPractice bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

## Interactions

### Mouse

- If a card does not contain an action behavior, do not provide hover feedback.
- If a card has a singular action behavior, the entire card can be clickable. Provide a hand cursor change and large elevation on hover.
- If a card contains a multiple action behaviors, such as a primary action and a secondary action, provide the documented hover feedback on the individual actionable elements only.

### Keyboard

| Key         | Interaction                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tab         | Move forward through the cards (if entire card is clickable) or through logical order of the interactive elements.    |
| Shift + Tab | Move backward through the cards (if entire card is clickable) or through logical order of the interactive elements.   |
| Enter       | Perform the card action (if entire card is clickable) or the corresponding action of the focused interactive element. |

## Accessibility

Card titles should use a Heading of the correct semantic level based on where the card is in the document. For example, a card nested under a Heading level 2 should use a Heading level 3 for its title.

Don't use Text for the card title as this will hurt the experience for users of assisstive technologies.
