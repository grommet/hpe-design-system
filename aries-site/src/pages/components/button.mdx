# Button Component

The Button component is a fundamental interactive element within the HPE Design System, enabling users to trigger actions, submit forms, or navigate. This documentation provides comprehensive guidance on its usage, styling, behavior, and accessibility, ensuring a consistent and effective user experience across all HPE applications.

**Last Updated:** August 7, 2025

 

 

## Anatomy and Core Principles

Buttons are interactive elements that trigger an immediate action or event. They are crucial for user interaction, enabling actions like submitting data, saving changes, or initiating processes. Understanding their fundamental structure and usage principles is key to effective design.

### Button Labeling

Labels should be concise, action-oriented verbs that clearly describe the Button's function. Avoid generic labels like 'Click Here' or 'Submit'.

#### When to use "Add", "Create", and "New"

- **Add**: Use when adding an existing item to a list, collection, or group (e.g., 'Add User to Group', 'Add Item to Cart'). The item already exists and is being associated.
- **Create**: Use when generating a new, distinct entity or resource (e.g., 'Create Volume', 'Create New Report'). This action typically involves defining new properties for the entity.
- **New**: Use when initiating the creation of a new item, often leading to a form or wizard where the details of the new item will be defined (e.g., 'New Server', 'New Project'). It implies starting a creation process.

### Button Alignment

Consistent alignment helps users predict where to find actions.

- **Left-aligned**: For drawers, forms, and filters, aligning with the natural content flow and reading direction.
- **Right-aligned**: For wizards, modals, and notifications, typically at the bottom right to signify completion or the primary action, often paired with a 'Cancel' Button to its left.

### Button Ordering

When multiple Buttons are present, order them logically to guide the user's eye and prioritize actions. The recommended order is Primary, Secondary, Default (from left to right or top to bottom).

### Buttons vs. Anchors

It is crucial to distinguish between Buttons and anchors (links) based on their intended action:

- Always use the Grommet Button component for actions that modify data, submit forms, or trigger in-page functionality (e.g., 'Save', 'Delete', 'Open Modal'). Buttons perform an action.
- Always use the native HTML `<a>` (anchor/link) element for navigation to a different page, a different section within the same page, or an external resource (e.g., 'View Details', 'Learn More', 'Go to Dashboard'). Anchors navigate.

### Cancel Buttons

'Cancel' Buttons are typically a Default or Secondary Button variant. Always label them 'Cancel' and position them to the left of the primary action Button in a Button group.

### Toggle Buttons

Toggle Buttons switch between two or more states or activate/deactivate a setting. They can include icons for clarity. For icon-only toggle Buttons, always provide an accessible title (e.g., via `aria-label`) to convey their purpose.

 

## Button Variants

The HPE Design System provides a range of Button variants, each designed for specific use cases and visual prominence. Choosing the correct variant ensures consistency and guides user interaction effectively.

### Primary Button

Highlights the most important action on a page or within a specific context. Use for critical, high-impact actions that users are most likely to take (e.g., 'Save Changes', 'Deploy', 'Submit'). Limit to one primary Button per view.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Button, Box } from 'grommet';

const PrimaryButtonExample = () => (
  <Box align='center' pad='medium'>
    <Button label='Create New Volume' primary onClick={() => {}} />
  </Box>
);

export default PrimaryButtonExample;
```

### Secondary Button

Use for less prominent actions that are still important but not the primary focus. Often used in conjunction with a Primary Button, offering an alternative or less critical path (e.g., 'Edit', 'Download', 'Add Another').

### CTA Button (Call to Action)

Specifically designed for marketing contexts to drive user conversion or engagement. Visually distinct and highly prominent, CTA Buttons are used sparingly—ideally one per context or region—to guide users towards a specific, high-value action (e.g., 'Get Started', 'Buy Now', 'Request a Demo').

### Toolbar Button

Compact Buttons, often icon-only, designed for use within toolbars, headers, or dense interfaces where space is limited. They typically represent common actions related to the content they accompany (e.g., 'Refresh', 'Settings', 'Filter').

### Default Button

The least prominent Button style, used for less critical actions, 'Cancel' actions, or as a fallback when other variants are not appropriate. It has minimal styling to blend into the interface (e.g., 'Cancel', 'Clear Filters').

### Button with Icon

Combines text with an icon to enhance clarity, provide visual cues, or save horizontal space. The icon can be positioned leading (before the text) or trailing (after the text). Useful for actions that benefit from a visual metaphor (e.g., 'Add User', 'Download Report').

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Button, Box } from 'grommet';
import { Add } from 'grommet-icons';

const IconButtonExample = () => (
  <Box align='center' pad='medium'>
    <Button icon={<Add />} label='Add User' onClick={() => {}} />
  </Box>
);

export default IconButtonExample;
```

### Button with Badge

Displays a small badge (e.g., a number or status indicator) to provide additional context or indicate counts relevant to the Button's action. Commonly used for notifications or item counts (e.g., 'Notifications (3)', 'Cart (2)').

### Button Sizes

Buttons are available in various sizes to accommodate different contexts and touch targets:

- **Small (`sm`)**: For dense tables, compact interfaces, or situations where space is at a premium.
- **Medium (`md`)**: The default size, suitable for general use across most applications.
- **Large (`lg`)**: For prominent actions, touch interfaces, or when a larger target area is beneficial.
- **X-Large (`xl`)**: Reserved for very prominent Call to Action (CTA) Buttons or hero sections where maximum visual impact is desired.

 

## Button States

Buttons can exist in several states, each providing visual feedback to the user about its current status and interactivity.

- **Default**: The standard appearance of the Button when it is ready for interaction.
- **Hover**: Visual feedback provided when the user's pointer is positioned over the Button, indicating it is interactive.
- **Focus**: A clear visual indicator when the Button has keyboard focus, essential for keyboard navigation and accessibility.
- **Active/Pressed**: Visual feedback when the Button is being clicked or activated, showing it is currently engaged.
- **Disabled**: Indicates the Button is not currently interactive and cannot be clicked. It should be visually distinct (e.g., greyed out) and not respond to any input.
- **Busy/Loading**: Indicates an ongoing process after the Button has been clicked, preventing further interaction until the process completes. This state often includes a spinner or loading animation within the Button.
- **Success**: A temporary state indicating that the action triggered by the Button has completed successfully. This provides immediate feedback to the user (e.g., a checkmark icon or a brief color change).

 

## Best Practices

Adhering to these best practices ensures that Buttons are used effectively, consistently, and provide an optimal user experience across all HPE applications.

### When to Use Buttons

Buttons are specifically designed for triggering immediate actions or events within the current context. If the interaction leads to a new page, an external resource, or a different section of the current page, consider using an anchor (`<a>`) instead. Buttons should always have a clear, actionable purpose.

### Primary Button Distinction

It is important to differentiate between the two main types of 'primary' Buttons:

- **CTA Buttons (Call to Action)**: These are primarily for marketing and conversion purposes. They are visually distinct and should be used sparingly (ideally one per context or region) to guide users towards a specific, high-value action (e.g., 'Get Started', 'Buy Now'). Their goal is to entice and convert.
- **Primary Action Buttons**: For enterprise applications, these Buttons assist users in accomplishing their goals within a workflow. They highlight common or important actions (e.g., 'Create', 'Save', 'Deploy') that are essential for completing a task. Avoid using CTA styling for general primary actions within application interfaces to prevent visual clutter and maintain focus on core functionality.

### Consistent Labeling Conventions

Always adhere to the established guidelines for Button labeling, especially for common actions like 'Add', 'Create', and 'New'. Consistent labeling reduces cognitive load and improves predictability for users.

### Logical Alignment and Ordering

Always follow the established alignment rules (left for forms/drawers, right for modals/wizards) and ordering (Primary, Secondary, Default). This consistency ensures an intuitive user flow and helps users quickly locate the actions they need.

### Responsiveness

Designing Buttons for responsiveness is crucial to ensure usability and visual consistency across various devices and screen sizes.

- **General Responsiveness**: Buttons should be designed to adapt gracefully to all browser widths and resolutions.
- **Label Integrity**: Ensure that Button labels do not wrap onto multiple lines or truncate. Text within Buttons should never scale down to fit smaller spaces; instead, adjust the Button's width or the layout of Button groups.
- **Minimum Width**: Maintain a minimum Button width of 42px to ensure sufficient touch target usability, especially on touch-enabled devices.
- **Single Buttons on Small Screens (&lt;= 576px)**: When a single Button is present on small screens, it should expand to fill the full width of its container to maximize tap target size and visibility.
- **Button Groups on Small Screens (&lt;= 576px)**: For Button groups on small screens, the Buttons should reorder vertically, stacking one above the other, to optimize for smaller viewports and prevent horizontal scrolling or cramped layouts.

 

## Accessibility

### A11y Guidance: Choosing the Correct HTML Element

Accessibility is paramount for Buttons. The choice of HTML element directly impacts how assistive technologies interpret and interact with the component.

- **Always use the Grommet Button component**: For all actions that trigger an event or modify content on the current page. This provides built-in keyboard interaction (Tab, Enter, Spacebar), focus management, and semantic meaning for screen readers and other assistive technologies. It is the most robust and accessible choice.
- **Always use the native HTML `<a>` (anchor) element**: For navigation to a new URL or a different section of the same page. Anchors are semantically designed for navigation.
- **Never use `<div>` or `<span>` elements with ARIA roles to simulate Buttons**: This approach requires significant effort to replicate native Button behavior (keyboard interaction, focus management, correct ARIA attributes for states) and often falls short, creating accessibility barriers.

### WCAG Compliance Status

The HPE Design System Button component is designed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring it is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users.

#### Perceivable

- **Color Contrast**: Sufficient contrast ratios are maintained between Button text and background, as well as between different Button states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled) to ensure readability for users with low vision.
- **Non-text Content**: Icons used within Buttons have appropriate alternative text (e.g., via `aria-label` or visually hidden text) or are hidden from assistive technologies if purely decorative.

#### Operable

- **Keyboard Navigation**: All Button variants are fully navigable and operable using standard keyboard interactions (Tab to focus, Enter/Spacebar to activate).
- **Focus Indicator**: A clear, visible, and distinct focus indicator is provided for all interactive states, allowing keyboard users to easily identify the currently focused element.
- **Target Size**: Buttons meet the minimum target size requirements (e.g., 44x44px for touch targets where applicable, or 24x24px with sufficient spacing) to ensure they are easily clickable/tappable.

#### Understandable

- **Predictable Behavior**: Button actions are consistent and predictable, reducing user confusion.
- **Labels**: Clear, concise, and descriptive labels are provided, either visually or via `aria-label` for icon-only Buttons, ensuring their purpose is easily understood by all users, including those using screen readers.

#### Robust

- **Semantic HTML**: The component primarily utilizes the native `<button>` element, ensuring maximum compatibility with various user agents, browsers, and assistive technologies.
- **ARIA Attributes**: Appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-disabled` for disabled states, `aria-live` regions for busy states that provide dynamic updates) are used when necessary to convey state and information to assistive technologies, enhancing the overall user experience for individuals with disabilities.
