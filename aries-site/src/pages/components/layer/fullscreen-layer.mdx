## Anatomy

See [general layer anatomy](/components/layer#anatomy) for specifications applying to all layers.

Fullscreen layers fill the entire page. Therefore, there no rounding or elevation is visible.

### Grommet properties

Apply these [layer properties](https://v2.grommet.io/layer) for a fullscreen layer.

| Property                                 | Value |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----- |
| [full](https://v2.grommet.io/layer#full) | true  |

## Layer closing behavior

### Informational

For informational side drawer layers that do not require any user actions, place a [close icon](/foundation/icons#ui-actions) button in the layer header.

<Example plain>
  <FullscreenLayerAnatomy informational />
</Example>

| Label | Region           | Purpose           | Required? | Notes                 |
| ----- | ---------------- | ----------------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| **1** | **Close button** | Closes the layer. | required  | Use "FormClose" icon. |

The user should be able to close the informational layer by clicking on the close button, clicking outside, the layer, or using the Escape key.

### Actionable

For actionable layers, include the [close icon](/foundation/icons#ui-actions) button in the header and a "Cancel" button alongside footer actions so the user can efficiently leave the layer if desired.

<Example plain>
  <FullscreenLayerAnatomy />
</Example>

| Label | Region            | Purpose           | Required? | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----- | ----------------- | ----------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Close button**  | Closes the layer. | required  | Including the close button in the header in addition to the footer "Cancel" button ensures the user can efficiently exit the layer if desired.                                                                                         |
| **2** | **Cancel button** | Closes the layer. | required  | The footer actions should be left aligned with primary action on the left and "Cancel" button following. The "Cancel" button should always be present as a complement to the primary action, providing an easy way to leave the layer. |

### Double confirmations

When data has been edited or changed and the user tries to close the layer, a double confirmation should be shown. This helps avoid unintentional loss of work.

Learn more about the anatomy and implementation of a [double confirmation](/components/layer#double-confirmations) on the main layer page since this behavior applies to all layer types.

## Scroll behavior

The default behavior of the layer is to allow all of the content to scroll, but this behavior can be modified depending on the layer's contents.

| Layer contents | Sticky region                                                                                         | Scroll region                   | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Wizard**     | Header and footer                                                                                     | Body                            | A sticky footer ensures the user always has access to advance in the wizard. A sticky header maintains the wizard's context and provides persistent access to move a step back in the wizard or cancel out. |
| **Form**       | None or header can be sticky/appear on scroll up if this added context is valueable for the use case. | All content, or body and footer | The footer actions should be at the bottom of the form to encourage the user to see the entire form before submission.                                                                                      |

## Examples

### Wizard

A wizard is a specialized fullscreen layer where a task flow is divided into multiple steps. See [wizard guidance](/templates/wizard) for examples and details.
