## When to use

A layer should be used to present information or task flows to the user without navigating them away from their current context.

## Anatomy

Basic anatomy and spacing that applies to all layer types.

<Example plain>
  <LayerAnatomy />
</Example>

A layer contains three main content regions:

1. **Header** (required): This region identifies the layer.
   - **a. Title** (required): A short, descriptive title identifying the layer, implemented as a Heading level 2.
   - **b. Subtitle** (optional): Any additional context or information about the layer.
1. **Body** (optional): Any additional content.
1. **Footer** (optional) - This region contains layer actions. The ordering and aligment of footer actions depends on the type of layer. See guidance on [types of layers](#types-of-layers) for details.

### Container styles

| Style     | T-shirt size | px  |
| --------- | ------------ | --- |
| pad       | medium       | 24  |
| gap       | medium       | 24  |
| elevation | large        | --  |
| round     | small        | 12  |

## Types of layers

Different use cases and content warrant different layer types. Learn more about each type below.

<LayerTypes />

## Layer closing behavior

### Mouse

The closing behavior and anatomy of a layer will differ depending on if the layer is informational or actionable.

#### Informational

For informational layers that do not require any user actions, place a close button in the layer header.

<Example plain>
  <InformationalLayerClose />
</Example>

- The "X" button should close the layer.
- The user can also click outside of the layer to close it.

#### Actionable

For actionable layers that require user actions, place a "Cancel" action alongside the other footer actions. In some cases, a label other than "Cancel" may be appropriate.

Do not include an "X" button in the header to avoid confusion of how the user should close the layer.

<Example plain>
  <ActionableLayerClose />
</Example>

- The "Cancel" button should reject any changes and close the layer.
- To prevent the user from losing progress due to accidentally misclicking outside of a layer, they should not be able to click outside of the layer to close it.

<Notification
  status="info"
  message="The ordering and alignment of footer actions depends on the type of layer. See anatomy diagrams for specific layer types for details."
  actions={[{ label: 'See layer types', href: '#types-of-layers' }]}
  width="large"
  margin={{ bottom: 'medium' }}
/>

### Keyboard

| Key | Interaction                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Esc | Close the layer and return focus to the element on the page the originally opened the layer. If the user has input any data into the layer, provide a double confirmation before closing the layer. |

## Accessibility

### Layer titles

Layer headings should be semantically correct. Treat a Layer as if it were a stand alone page, with the exception that the first heading within a Layer should be an `h2` or `<Heading level={2} />`. All subsequent headings should follow typical [semantic heading structure](/foundation/typography#semantic-usage-of-heading-levels).

### Close button

When using a Layer with `modal={false}`, it is critical that the focus is moved to the "Close" button inside the Layer. This close button should also be given an `a11yTitle` that provides the user with context that they are in a Layer.

For example, implementation of this "Close" button for a Layer would be:

```
<Button
  a11yTitle={`You are in a layer containing a form to add new hosts.
  To close this layer, press Enter.`}
  icon={<FormClose />}
  onClick={() => setShowLayer(false)}
  autoFocus
/>
```
