## Anatomy

<Example plain>
  <SideDrawerLayerAnatomy />
</Example>

1. **Header**: This region identifies the layer. There should be a `gap="small"` between title and subtitle. If the layer is actionable, the header should be [sticky](#header-behavior).
   - **a. Title** (required): A short, descriptive title identifying the wizard implemented as a Heading level 2.
   - **b. Subtitle** (optional): Any additional context or information about the layer.
   - **c. Close button** (optional): A button to close the layer. This should only be used in informational layers.
1. **Body** (optional): This region houses any additional content.
1. **Footer**: The footer contains layer actions. The actions should be left-aligned with primary action on the left. Actions should only appear in actionable layers.

## Guidance

Provides users with any type of action, required or optional. These can be confirmations, filters, forms, etc.

Actionable Layers contain the following elements and interactions:

- A cancel or close button will always be positioned within the footer of the Layer. Note that the "X" icon is omitted to avoid any confusion the user may have on which option they should use to close out the Layer.
- The Layer header should be sticky while the rest of the Layer content is scrollable. This can either be achieved with a [persistent sticky header](#layer-form-with-sticky-header) or a [header that is sticky when the user scrolls up](#layer-form-with-hide-show-sticky-header).

## Header behavior

The default behavior of the layer header is to scroll with the layer content.

However, actionable layers should have a sticky header that is either persistent or appears when the user scrolls up.

### Persistent sticky header

The Layer header and action buttons can be sticky while the rest of the Layer content is scrollable. This can be accomblished by wrapping a Form within a Box with `overflow` set to `auto`.

  ]}
  height={{ min: 'small' }}

  <LayerStickyExample />
</Example>

### Scroll up sticky header

In order to maximize screen real-estate when content is scrollable, the header may scroll away as the user scrolls down but reappear as the user scrolls up. This can be accomblished by using the `sticky` prop
on Heading and setting it to `"scrollup"`.
