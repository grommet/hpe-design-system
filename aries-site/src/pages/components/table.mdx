## What Makes Up a Table?
Tables enable users to accomplish a task by finding records of interest, then take action against them.
They present structured data in a grid, with columns and rows to aid readability, scanability, and show 
the meaning of the data.

<TableAnatomy />

**Controls**<br />
Table controls should live above the table and facilitate a user's ability to locate and 
take actions against records of interest. A controls section may contain search and filter 
controls, as well as action controls such as batch applying settings or data export.
[About table controls >](#sorting)

**Columns**<br />
Contain a single data type and help users scan, read and take action through data.
They may be enhanced by allowing users to sort or filter records by the column's data.

**Rows**<br />
Rows help users scan, read and take action through data. 
They may be enhanced by actions such as selection and navigation to record detail.
[Row detail >](#record-selection)


**Cells**<br />
Commonly contain numerical and textual data, but may also include visuals such as meters, 
status indicators, anchors, and buttons.

## When to Use
Users interacting with a Table are trying to accomplish one of the following types of tasks.
They are not, however, trying to do all of these tasks at once.
Keeping "what is the user setting out to accompish?" at the center of our mindset helps guide which 
table features to include and, more importantly, exclude when we add a Table to our interfaces.

- Finding and taking action against a specific record. (Searching)
- Narrowing a result set down to a group of records sharing similar characteristics. (Filtering)
- Facilitate scanning of records to identify potential outliers or records which the user is unaware need attention or action. (Browsing)
- Assembling a data set for analysis. (Filtering)

### Finding a Specific Record
Search experience

<ExampleImagePreview
  label="See Finding a Specific Record"
  href="#"
  src="/static/images/Finding_Specific_Records.png"
  alt="Example demonstrating how to find a record of interest with a Table"
/>

### Narrowing a Result Set
Filtering experience
- Batch actions

<ExampleImagePreview

  alt="Example demonstrating how to find a record of interest with a Table"
/>

### Browsing a Result Set

## Guidelines

### Search vs. Filter?
Complimenatary elements such as search or filters should be guided by the task the user 
is setting out to accomplish.
- Looking for a specific record? --> Search.
- Trying to narrow records down to a set of shared characteristics? --> Filter.
- Not quite certain for what I am looking, but I know its general characteristics? --> Filter.

[See Searching & Filtering]() for greater detail.

### Pagination vs. Infinite Scroll
Should be guided by the task the user is setting out to accomplish.

- Browsing? --> Infinite Scroll
  - Perhaps I am reviewing a customer's account history. I am not looking for 
  a particular record, rather I am in scanning mode, trying to get a sense of 
  the volume and types of interaction with a customer over time. Infinite Scroll 
  creates a nice, frictionless experirence for this to occur.
- Searching for a specific record? --> It depends.
  - Do you have a good search experience? --> Infinite Scroll
  - Do you have a performant API?
  - Do you require page reloads?
  - Is your data structured? 
- Do rows have many interactive elements? --> Pagination
  - Be mindful of keyboard users.

### How many columns?
The number of columns and rows should be guided by the task the user is setting 
out to accomplish.

Generally, if there are more than 5-7 columns in the table, it is a sign that 
a single table is trying to solve too many user problems at once. In that case, 
consider:
- Are there too many user persona types using this view? If so, are there opportunities 
to personalize the view by role?
- What are the user interactions leading up to the table view? Are there opportunities 
to improve navigation and build intentful user flows?
- Perhaps, it is unclear as to what the user problem the table is attempting 
to solve? A good opportunity for speaking to and learning from end users!

**The Exception**<br />
In an analytical context, where the goal is to assemble a data set and identify patterns 
within it, a larger number of columns may be neccessary.

In this context, a Table should facilitate the assembly of the data set and make the set 
accessible in a tool specifically designed for analysis.
