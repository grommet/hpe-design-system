## What Makes Up a Table? (Why & What)
Tables enable users to accomplish a task by finding records of interest, then take action against them.
They present structured data in a grid, with columns and rows to aid readability, scanability, and show 
the meaning of the data.

<Box align="start" fill height={{max: 'medium'}} margin={{top: 'small', bottom: 'medium'}} >
  <Image src="/static/images/Table_Anatomy.svg" />
</Box>

**Columns**<br />
Contain a single data type and help users scan, read and take action through data.
They may be enhanced by allowing users to sort or filter records by the column's data.

**Rows**<br />
Rows help users scan, read and take action through data. 
They may be enhanced by actions such as selection and navigation to record detail.

**Cells**<br />
Commonly contain numerical and textual data, but may also include visuals such as meters, 
status indicators, anchors, and buttons.

## When to Use (When)

- Finding and taking action agains a specific record. (Searching)

<Box align="start" height={{max: 'medium'}} width="medium" margin={{top: 'small', bottom: 'medium'}} >
  <Image src="/static/images/Finding_Specific_Records.png" fit="cover" fill />
</Box>

<Box align="start" gap="medium">
  <Box
    width="medium"
    height=""
    round="small"
    elevation="medium"
    overflow="hidden"
  >
    <Image fit="cover" src="/static/images/Finding_Specific_Records.png" />
  </Box>
  <Anchor label="See Example" href="#" />
</Box>

- Narrowing a result set down to a group of records sharing similar characteristics. (Filtering)
- Facilitate scanning of records to identify potential outliers or records which the user is unaware need attention or action. (Browsing)
- Assembling a data set for analysis. (Filtering)

## Guidelines (How)
### Too many columns?
The number of columns and rows should be guided by the task the user is setting 
out to accomplish.

Generally, if there are more than 5-7 columns in the table, it is a sign that 
a single table is trying to solve too many user problems at once. In that case, 
consider:
- Are there too many user persona types using this view? If so, are there opportunities 
to personalize the view by role?
- What are the user interactions leading up to the table view? Are there opportunities 
to improve navigation and build intentful user flows?
- Perhaps, it is unclear as to what the user problem the table is attempting 
to solve? A good opportunity for speaking to and learning from end users!

**The Exception**

In an analytical context, where the goal is to assemble a data set and identify patterns 
within it, a larger number of columns may be neccessary.

In this context, a Table should facilitate the assembly of the data set and make the set 
accessible in a tool specifically designed for analysis.

### Search vs. Filter?
Great question. 

Complimenatary elements such as search or filters should be guided by the task the user 
is setting out to accomplish.
- Trying to find a specific record? --> Search.
- Trying to narrow records down to a set of shared characteristics? --> Filter.
- Not quite certain for what I am looking, but I know its general characteristics? --> Filter.

... btw, what's the difference anyway? ðŸ¤”

[See Searching & Filtering]() for greater detail.

### Pagination vs. Infinite Scroll
Should be guided by the task the user is setting out to accomplish.

- Browsing? --> Infinite Scroll
  - Perhaps I am reviewing a customer's account history. I am not looking for 
  a particular record, rather I am in scanning mode, trying to get a sense of 
  the volume and types of interaction with a customer over time. Infinite Scroll 
  creates a nice, frictionless experirence for this to occur.
- Searching for a specific record? --> It depends.
  - Do you have a good search experience? --> Infinite Scroll
  - Do you have a performant API?
  - Do you require page reloads?
  - Is your data structured? 
- Do rows have many interactive elements? --> Pagination
  - Be mindful of keyboard users.
