## Guidance

RangeInput allows a user to easily select a value lying between a minimum and maximum range.
The value is selected by sliding a thumb control across the track.

- The RangeInput should be clear within the label for the user to know what value they are choosing.
- Each end of the range should be labeled by the minimum and maximum values so the user is aware of the range's possible values.
- Do not use ranges that are to large i.e 1-10000 or ranges that are very small i.e 1-3

### Usage

RangeInput can be used when a user needs to choose a value within a fixed range of values.

Changes made to RangeInput are immediate which allows the user to make adjustments when
selecting their value.

A RangeInput can be used when the value is less important to the user than the visual of seeing the difference between the min and the max.

### Accessibility

RangeInput should be used inside of a FormField to ensure that a label is properly associated with the input.

If a RangeInput is used outside of the context of a FormField, it is important to meet accessibility requirements in an alternate way. There should always be clear visual indication, either by text or icon, that describes the purpose of the RangeInput.

## Variants

### RangeInput with Description

Adding a description provides the user additional information about the context or purpose of the RangeInput.

<Example code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/rangeinput/RangeInputDescriptionExample">
  <RangeInputDescriptionExample />
</Example>

### RangeInput within a form

RangeInput can be used within a form and should not be something that is required.

<Example code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/rangeinput/RangeInputInFormExample">
  <RangeInputInFormExample />
</Example>
