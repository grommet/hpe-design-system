import { Example } from '../../layouts';
import { DataExample } from '../../examples/components/';

Data is the orchestrator for a set of subcomponents. These components work together to create the entirety of the experience, we like to refer to them as "Data and friends".

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/data/DataExample.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/data"
  template
  height="auto"
  showResponsiveControls={['fullScreen']}
>
  <DataExample />
</Example>

For additional guidance on filtering patterns, see the [filtering documentation](/templates/filtering).

## How to use

There are two main ways to build with Data and friends:

| Approach          | Definition                                                                                                                                                     | Notes                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Configurable**  | This approach relies solely on the properties available on the Data component itself.                                                                          | --                                                                                                                |
| **Compositional** | This approach allows you to import the subcomponents directly to compose your layout, while still leveraging some of the properties on Data for configuration. | This approach is most useful when you want to add additional controls to the toolbar beyond search and filtering. |
