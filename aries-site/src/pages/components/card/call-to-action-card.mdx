This type of card is more commonly used within marketing contexts and should be used sparingly within HPE products and services. Secondary purposes might include an action to navigate to a screen with greater detail on the offering.

## Anatomy

<Example plain>
  <CallToActionAnatomy />
</Example>

1. **Card identifier**: This region is intended to provide the user with context on what the card is about.
   - a. **Title** (required): For Call to action cards, this should be a unique, enticing headline to capture the user's attention.
   - b. **Pretitle** (optional): Additional context for what this call to action is about (e.g., "Virtual event").
   - c. **Subtitle** (optional): Any concise, additional supportive text to help establish the card's identity and context.
1. **Actions** (required): Card-level actions.
   - A primary or solid-filled button labelled with the main call to action is required. At times, additional supporting actions/links may be appropriate.
1. **Description** (optional): A short paragraph that elaborates on the card's purpose.
1. **Image/Media** (optional): An eye-catching, [brand-approved image](https://brandcentral.hpe.com/brand-central/content/distinctive-brand-assets/flexible-ingredients#p1-photography-style-1) that grabs the user's attention. Use of this area should be reserved for highly promotional cards like events and feature announcements.
1. **Background** (optional): A background color or [brand-approved texture/gradient](https://brandcentral.hpe.com/brand-central/content/distinctive-brand-assets/flexible-ingredients#c3-color-and-texture-style-3).
   - When using a texture or gradient, be mindful to maintain appropriate color contrast between the card's text and the background.

## Presentation

- Call to action cards may be presented in a group with other call to action cards but also may be presented on their own.
- When presented in a group, their layout/treatment can be independent from the layout/treatment of the surrounding call to action cards.
- Highly promotional call to action cards, such as event promotions, incorporate stronger visual elements. Less promotional cards, such as software updates, are more subtle.
  - Use cases (ordered from highest visual emphasis to lowest) include event promotion, new feature release, trial promotion, and software upgrades.

## Examples

These are example layouts for various use cases.

### Event promotion

Event announcements are highly promotional, so they should leverage attention-grabbing card elements such as images, that accentuate the dynamic and vibrant experience that an HPE event provides.

<Example
  componentName="Card"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/card/EventPromotionCard.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/card?theme=hpe#props"
  figma="https://www.figma.com/design/HDckqS2MWhINfC8EIQPMV1/HPE-Design-System-Components-V2?node-id=3062-2494&t=ER8ttf2IxrXcy6CR-4"
  grommetSource="https://github.com/grommet/grommet/blob/master/src/js/components/Card/Card.js"
>
  <EventPromotionCard />
</Example>

### Event promotion (row-orientation)

Depending on where a card is presented in a layout, it may be more appropriate for its content to be displayed in a row.

<Example
  componentName="Card"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/card/EventPromotionRowCard.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/card?theme=hpe#props"

  grommetSource="https://github.com/grommet/grommet/blob/master/src/js/components/Card/Card.js"
>
  <EventPromotionRowCard />
</Example>

### Feature update

Announcements about new offerings and features should excite current and potential customers about HPE's services. The use of this brand-approved gradient allows this card to stand out from its surrounding content.

<Example
  componentName="Card"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/card/FeaturePromotionCard.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/card?theme=hpe#props"

  grommetSource="https://github.com/grommet/grommet/blob/master/src/js/components/Card/Card.js"
>
  <FeaturePromotionCard />
</Example>

### Trial promotion (background image)

The use of this brand-approved texture subtley differentiates this card from surrounding content.

  grommetSource="https://github.com/grommet/grommet/blob/master/src/js/components/Card/Card.js"
>
  <TrialPromotionCard />
</Example>

### Trial promotion (row-orientation)

Depending on where a card is presented in a layout, it may be more appropriate for its content to be displayed in a row.

<Example

  grommetSource="https://github.com/grommet/grommet/blob/master/src/js/components/Card/Card.js"
>
  <TrialPromotionRowCard />
</Example>

### Trial promotion (background color)

A colored background can be used to differentiate a card from its surroundings.

<Example
  componentName="Card"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/card/TrialPromotionColorCard.js"

  grommetSource="https://github.com/grommet/grommet/blob/master/src/js/components/Card/Card.js"
>
  <TrialPromotionColorCard />
</Example>

### Feature release

An attention-grabbing title attracts user attention and encourages them to upgrade to the latest version.

<Example
  componentName="Card"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/card/FeatureReleaseCard.js"
