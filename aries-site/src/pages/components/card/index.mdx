## Principles

Cards are containers that display content and actions on a single topic. They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information.

**Contained** - A card is identifiable as a single, contained unit.

**Independent** - A card can stand alone, without relying on surrounding elements for context.

**Individual** - A card cannot merge with another card, or divide into multiple cards.

**Summarized** - A card by nature has limited real-estate, so it should present summarized information.

## When to use

- Presenting high-level, summarized pieces of information.
- Presenting an item, or collection of items, which can best be consumed visually.

In all cases the presentation allows users to quickly scan the content and navigate to underlying detail if desired.

## When not to use

- Cards should not be used as a control to filter data on the same screen. A button is the appropriate control to apply a filter. Alternatively, cards may be used to present summarized information and allow a user to navigate to a pre-filtered view of that information.

<BestPracticeGroup>
  <Example
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message:
        'Style status filter buttons as default buttons when the buttons are placed on the same page as the data they will be filtering.',
    }}
    scale={0.4}
    width="100%"
  >
    <CardFilteringBestPractice />
  </Example>
  <Example
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don’t use a card to wrap a set of status filter buttons that affect data on the same page. Cards should act as independent regions that do not affect surrounding content. However, placing these buttons in a Card would be appropriate on a dashboard, where clicking on one of the status buttons would navigate to a different page that is filtered by the selected status.`,
    }}
    scale={0.4}
    width="100%"
  >
    <CardFilteringBestPractice bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

- A Card should not be used to group complex content into a single container. A card is meant to be individual, presenting a single, summarized topic which cannot be divided.

<BestPracticeGroup>
  <Example
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message: 'Place non-Card page content flush on the page.',
    }}
    scale={0.4}
    width="100%"
  >
    <CardContentBestPractice />
  </Example>
  <Example
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don’t use a Card solely as a way to denote a layout region of related content.`,
    }}
    scale={0.4}
    width="100%"
  >
    <CardContentBestPractice bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

- When data attributes across items needs to be analyzed, sorted, compared and filtered, a Card may not be the best tool. Instead, [DataTable](/components/datatable) may be more appropriate.

## Types of cards

A card is a rich, flexible UI component; its anatomy, visual/interactive treatments, and relationship to its peers help to establish and reinforce its purpose. The following are distinct types of cards that have unique purposes and best practices:

### Call-to-action

Entice the user down a desired path.

<Link href="/components/card/call-to-action-card" passHref>
  <Button
    label="Call-to-action card guidance"
    icon={<FormNextLink />}
    reverse
    primary
    alignSelf="start"
    margin={{ bottom: 'medium' }}
  />
</Link>

<Example>
  <EventPromotionCard />
</Example>

### Navigational

**Primary purpose:** Navigational cards provide the user with a means of wayfinding.

Navigational cards enable the user to identify, compare, and choose their desired next step.

<Link href="/components/card/navigational-card" passHref>
  <Button
    label="Navigational card guidance"
    icon={<FormNextLink />}
    reverse
    primary
    alignSelf="start"
    margin={{ bottom: 'medium' }}
  />
</Link>

<Example>
  <ActivitiesNavigationalCards heading={false} />
</Example>

### Status-based navigation

**Primary purpose:** Quickly assist the user to navigate to resources, tasks, or processes requiring their attention and/or action.

### Resource

**Primary purpose:** Allow a user to scan a set of resource options and choose one based on their needs.

Guidance for this card type is coming soon.

### Analytic

**Primary purpose:** Present measures and metrics in short, digestible content pieces and allow a user to navigate to underlying detail is needed.

Guidance for this card type is coming soon.

## Formatting

### Alignment

Use left-alignment whenever possible in order to optimize readability.

<BestPracticeGroup>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message: 'Left-align text and content.',
    }}
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardAlignmentBestPractice />
  </Example>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don't center text and content. This hurts readability.`,
    }}
    width="100%"
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardAlignmentBestPractice bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

### Spacing

For cards within the same layout section, place a minimum gap of "medium" between cards.

<BestPracticeGroup columns="100%">
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message: 'Use a "medium" gap between cards.',
    }}
    width="100%"
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardSpacingBestPractice />
  </Example>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don't use a gap smaller than "medium" between cards because this creates a crowded feeling.`,
    }}
    width="100%"
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardSpacingBestPractice bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

## Interactions

### Mouse

- If a card does not contain an action behavior, do not provide hover feedback.
- If a card has a singular action behavior, the entire card can be clickable. Provide a hand cursor change and large elevation on hover.
- If a card contains a multiple action behaviors, such as a primary action and a secondary action, provide the documented hover feedback on the individual actionable elements only.

### Keyboard

| Key         | Interaction                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tab         | Move forward through the cards (if entire card is clickable) or through logical order of the interactive elements.    |
| Shift + Tab | Move backward through the cards (if entire card is clickable) or through logical order of the interactive elements.   |
| Enter       | Perform the card action (if entire card is clickable) or the corresponding action of the focused interactive element. |

## Accessibility

### Card titles

Card titles should use a Heading of the correct [semantic heading level](foundation/typography#semantic-usage-of-heading-levels) based on where the card is in the document. For example, a card nested under a Heading level 2 should use a Heading level 3 for its title.

Don't use Text for the card title as this will hurt the experience for users of assisstive technologies.

### Card sections

When cards are presenting as a group, they should function as a list.

- Apply `as="ul"` or `as="ol"` (depending on if the list is orderded or not) to the cards' layout container (whether that be a [Grid](/components/grid), [List](/templates/lists), or other layout component).
  - Some default browser padding may need to be overridden. This can be done by applying `pad="none"`, or the desired padding, to the container.
- Apply `as="li"` to the individual cards.

Internally, the Card has a container that is implemented as a `section` that contains CardHeader (which translates to a `header`), CardBody, and CardFooter (which translates to a `footer`). This aligns with HTML spec which states that `header` and `footer` regions relate to their nearest sectioning content element.
