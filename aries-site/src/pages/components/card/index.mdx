## Principles

Cards are containers that display content and actions on a single topic. They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information.

**Contained** - A card is identifiable as a single, contained unit.

**Independent** - A card can stand alone, without relying on surrounding elements for context.

**Individual** - A card cannot merge with another card, or divide into multiple cards.

**Summarized** - A card by nature has limited real estate, so it should present summarized information.

Cards should be used when:

- Presenting high-level, summarized pieces of information.
- Presenting an item, or collection of items, which can best be consumed visually.

In all cases the presentation allows users to quickly scan the content and navigate to underlying detail if desired.

## Types of cards

A card is a rich, flexible UI component; its anatomy, visual/interactive treatments, and relationship to its peers help to establish and reinforce its purpose. The following are distinct types of cards that have unique purposes and best practices.

<CardTypes />

## Formatting

### Alignment

Use left-alignment whenever possible in order to optimize readability.

<BestPracticeGroup>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message: 'Left-align text and content.',
    }}
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardAlignmentBestPractice />
  </Example>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don't center text and content. This hurts readability.`,
    }}
    width="100%"
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardAlignmentBestPractice bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

### Spacing

Follow the [proximity principle](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/gestalt-proximity/) 
when applying spacing between a group of cards and between other content sections. Apply 
a uniform gap between cards so that they are perceived as belonging to the same group. This 
spacing should be less than the gap between other content sections.  

<Example
  width="100%"
  height={{ min: 'small' }}
>
  <CardSpacingBestPractice />
</Example>

## Interactions

### Mouse

- If a card does not contain an action behavior, do not provide hover feedback.
- If a card has a singular action behavior, the entire card may be clickable. 
Apply a `pointer` cursor and `large` elevation for the hover state.
- If a card contains multiple interactive elements, provide hover feedback on the interactive elements, not the card itself.

### Keyboard

| Key         | Interaction                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tab         | Move forward through the cards (if entire card is clickable) or through logical order of the interactive elements.    |
| Shift + Tab | Move backward through the cards (if entire card is clickable) or through logical order of the interactive elements.   |
| Enter       | Perform the card action (if entire card is clickable) or the corresponding action of the focused interactive element. |

## Accessibility

### Card titles

Card titles should use a Heading of the correct [semantic heading level](/foundation/typography#semantic-usage-of-heading-levels) 
based on where the card is in the document. For example, a card nested under a 
Heading level 2 should use a Heading level 3 for its title (Note: If desired, 
a heading's size may be adjusted to achieve the desired aethetic, but always use 
the proper level).

Text should not be used for the card titles. Assistive technologies rely on HTML 
heading or aria-labels for understanding a card's title.

### Card sections

When cards are presenting as a group, they should function as a list.

- Apply `as="ul"` or `as="ol"` (depending on if the list is orderded or not) to the cards' layout container (whether that be a [Grid](/components/grid), [List](/templates/lists), or other layout component).
  - Some default browser padding may need to be overridden. This can be done by applying `pad="none"`, or the desired padding, to the container.
- Apply `as="li"` to the individual cards.
