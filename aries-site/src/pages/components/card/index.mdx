## Principles

Cards are containers that display content and actions on a single topic. They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information.

**Contained** - A card is identifiable as a single, contained unit.

**Independent** - A card can stand alone, without relying on surrounding elements for context.

**Individual** - A card cannot merge with another card, or divide into multiple cards.

**Summarized** - A card by nature has limited real estate, so it should present summarized information.

Cards should be used when:

- Presenting high-level, summarized pieces of information.
- Presenting an item, or collection of items, which can best be consumed visually.

In all cases the presentation allows users to quickly scan the content and navigate to underlying detail if desired.

## Types of cards

A card is a rich, flexible UI component; its anatomy, visual/interactive treatments, and relationship to its peers help to establish and reinforce its purpose. The following are distinct types of cards that have unique purposes and best practices.

<CardTypes />

## Formatting

### Alignment

Use left-alignment whenever possible in order to optimize readability.

<BestPracticeGroup>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message: 'Left-align text and content.',
    }}
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardAlignmentBestPractice />
  </Example>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don't center text and content. This hurts readability.`,
    }}
    width="100%"
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardAlignmentBestPractice bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

### Spacing

For cards within the same layout section, place a minimum gap of "medium" between cards.

<BestPracticeGroup columns="100%">
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message: 'Use a "medium" gap between cards.',
    }}
    width="100%"
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardSpacingBestPractice />
  </Example>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don't use a gap smaller than "medium" between cards because this creates a crowded feeling.`,
    }}
    width="100%"
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
  >
    <CardSpacingBestPractice bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

## Interactions

### Mouse

- If a card does not contain an action behavior, do not provide hover feedback.
- If a card has a singular action behavior, the entire card can be clickable. Provide a hand cursor change and large elevation on hover.
- If a card contains a multiple action behaviors, such as a primary action and a secondary action, provide the documented hover feedback on the individual actionable elements only.

### Keyboard

| Key         | Interaction                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tab         | Move forward through the cards (if entire card is clickable) or through logical order of the interactive elements.    |
| Shift + Tab | Move backward through the cards (if entire card is clickable) or through logical order of the interactive elements.   |
| Enter       | Perform the card action (if entire card is clickable) or the corresponding action of the focused interactive element. |

## Accessibility

### Card titles

Card titles should use a Heading of the correct [semantic heading level](foundation/typography#semantic-usage-of-heading-levels) based on where the card is in the document. For example, a card nested under a Heading level 2 should use a Heading level 3 for its title.

Don't use Text for the card title as this will hurt the experience for users of assisstive technologies.

### Card sections

When cards are presenting as a group, they should function as a list.

- Apply `as="ul"` or `as="ol"` (depending on if the list is orderded or not) to the cards' layout container (whether that be a [Grid](/components/grid), [List](/templates/lists), or other layout component).
  - Some default browser padding may need to be overridden. This can be done by applying `pad="none"`, or the desired padding, to the container.
- Apply `as="li"` to the individual cards.

## Misuses

- When data attributes across items needs to be analyzed, sorted, compared, and filtered, a card may not be the best tool. Instead, [DataTable](/components/datatable) may be more appropriate tool to meet these needs.
- Cards should not be used as a control to filter data on the same screen. A button is the appropriate control to apply a filter. Alternatively, cards may be used to present summarized information and allow a user to navigate to a pre-filtered view of that information.

<BestPracticeGroup>
  <Example
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message:
        'Style status filter buttons as default buttons when the buttons are placed on the same page as the data they will be filtering.',
    }}
    scale={0.4}
    width="100%"
  >
    <CardFilteringBestPractice />
  </Example>
  <Example
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Donâ€™t use a card to wrap a set of status filter buttons if clicking on one of those buttons will filter data that exists on the same page as that card. Cards should act as independent regions that do not affect surrounding content. However, placing these buttons in a card would be appropriate on a dashboard, where clicking on one of the status buttons would navigate to a different page that is filtered by the selected status.`,
    }}
    scale={0.4}
    width="100%"
  >
    <CardFilteringBestPractice bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

- A card should not be used to group complex content into a single container. A card is meant to be individual, presenting a single, summarized topic which cannot be divided.

<BestPracticeGroup>
  <Example
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message:
        'Leave general page content outside of a card and align it flush with the left page margin.',
    }}
    scale={0.4}
    width="100%"
  >
    <CardContentBestPractice />
  </Example>
  <Example
    height={{ min: 'small' }}
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don't use a card just to show general page content. The purpose of a card is to group pieces of information that should be visually separated from the main page content in order to emphasize the relationship of those pieces to each other.`,
    }}
    scale={0.4}
    width="100%"
  >
    <CardContentBestPractice bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>
