## Getting to know Grid
Grid is a powerful tool. It provides tremendous flexibility and control enabling designers and 
developers at HPE to create optimal user experiences at any screen size or resolution!

However, with great power comes great responsibility. Well, in Grid's case, great power 
comes with a bit of a learning curve, but the following introduces the key concepts and
accelerate command of the tool.

### Background
Based on [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), 
Grommet's Grid simplifies and presents the API in a manner consistent with other components 
in the Grommet library.

Grid is composed of columns and rows and its properties allow for:
- Fixed column widths and row heights, when use cases desire precise dimensions for grid cells.
- Flexible column widths and heights, allowing grid cell contents to gracefully respond across 
a variety of browser widths.
- Fluid grids allowing columns and rows to grow and adapt to the content provided.
- Precise placement of elements within the grid via [areas]().

## Implementing Grid
The following implementations are not mutually exclusive. They may be mixed and matched
as desired, but are presented with the intent to focus on the key concepts for each approach.

### Fixed Grids

<Example
  componentName="Grid"
  horizontalLayout
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/card/CardExample.js"
>
  <FixedGrid />
</Example>
