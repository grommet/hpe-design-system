## Getting to know Grid
Grid is a powerful tool. It provides tremendous flexibility and control enabling designers and 
developers at HPE to create optimal user experiences at any screen size or resolution!

However, with great power comes great responsibility. Well, in Grid's case, great power 
comes with a bit of a learning curve, but the following introduces the key concepts and
accelerate command of the tool.

### Background
Based on [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), 
Grommet's Grid simplifies and presents the API in a manner consistent with other components 
in the Grommet library.

Grid is composed of columns and rows and its properties allow for:
- Fixed column widths and row heights, when use cases desire precise dimensions for grid cells.
- Flexible column widths and heights, allowing grid cell contents to gracefully respond across 
a variety of browser widths.
- Fluid grids allowing columns and rows to grow and adapt to the content provided.
- Precise placement of elements within the grid via [areas](#areas).

## Grid Properties & Key Concepts
Grid's primary properties include: [columns](#columns), [rows](#rows), and [areas](#areas). The 
following examples will demonstrate how these properties may be applied to affect 
[content layouts](/templates/content-layouts).

### Columns
Columns may be specified as uniform widths, mixed widths, a percentage of their containing element, 
or as min-max ranges which allow the contents to flex gracefully.

#### Uniform Columns
Uniform columns are ideal for presenting a collection of like items such as a grid of images, 
a catalog of services, or a [dashboard of cards](/templates/dashboards#three-column-dashboard).

Specifying the column width as single string will repeat multiple columns of that size, as long as 
there is room for more. For example, `columns="medium"` will fit as many "medium" columns into the 
grid as the overall width allows. Within a wide screen, this might allow 3 or 4 columns; within a narrow 
screen, maybe only 1 or 2.

<Example
  horizontalLayout
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/UniformColumns.js"
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
>
  <UniformColumns />
</Example>

#### Mixed-Width Columns
Mixed-width columns allow for control over layouts desiring columns of various widths to appropriately present 
their contents, establish content hierarchy with wider columns for primary content and narrower for secondary 
content such as an [activity feed](/templates/dashboards#two-column-dashboard).

Mixed-width columns are specified in an array. The number of items in the array dictate the number of columns 
in the grid. 

For example, columns specified as `columns={[ 'medium', 'small', 'small' ]}` would create a three 
column grid with corresponding widths: 

<Example
  horizontalLayout
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/MixedColumns1.js"
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
  height="auto"
>
  <MixedColumns1 />
</Example>

`columns={[ '2/3', '1/3' ]}` would result in two columns with proportional 
widths:

<Example
  horizontalLayout
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/MixedColumns2.js"
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
  height="auto"
>
  <MixedColumns2 />
</Example>

### Rows

## Implementing Grid
The following implementations are not mutually exclusive. They may be mixed and matched
as desired, but are presented with the intent to focus on the key concepts for each approach.

### Fluid Grids

### Fixed Grid
When approaching a design or implementation, beginning with a fixed grid is a great approach as 
it lays a foundation from which you can build and refine.

A fixed grid 

<Example
  horizontalLayout
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/FixedGrid.js"
>
  <FixedGrid />
</Example>
