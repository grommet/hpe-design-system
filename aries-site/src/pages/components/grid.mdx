## Getting to know Grid
Grid is a powerful tool. It provides tremendous flexibility and control enabling designers and 
developers at HPE to create optimal user experiences at any screen size or resolution.

With all of Grid's power, there is a bit of a learning curve. The following introduces its key 
concepts and will accelerate your command of the tool.

### Background
Based on [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), 
Grommet's Grid simplifies and presents the API in a manner consistent with other components 
in the Grommet library.

Grid is composed of columns and rows and its properties allow for:
- [Fixed](#fixed-grid) column widths and row heights, when use cases desire precise dimensions for grid cells.
- [Flexible](#flexible-grids) column widths and row heights, allowing grid cell contents to gracefully respond 
across a variety of browser widths.
- [Fluid grids](#fluid-grids) allowing columns and rows to grow and adapt to the content provided.
- Precise placement of elements within the grid via [areas](#areas).

## Grid Properties & Key Concepts
Grid's primary properties include: [columns](#columns), [rows](#rows), and [areas](#areas). The 
following examples will demonstrate how these properties may be applied to affect 
[content layouts](/templates/content-layouts).

### Columns
Columns may be specified as [uniform widths](#uniform-columns), [mixed widths](#mixed-width-columns), 
or as [min-max ranges](#flexible-columns) which allow the contents to flex gracefully.

#### Uniform Columns
Uniform columns are ideal for presenting a collection of like items such as a grid of images, 
a catalog of services, or a [dashboard of cards](/templates/dashboards#three-column-dashboard).

Specifying the column width as single string will repeat multiple columns of that size, as long as 
there is room for more. For example, `columns="medium"` will fit as many "medium" columns into the 
grid as the overall width allows. Within a wide screen, this might allow 3 or 4 columns; within a narrow 
screen, maybe only 1 or 2.

<Example
  horizontalLayout
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/UniformColumns.js"
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
>
  <UniformColumns />
</Example>

#### Mixed-Width Columns
Mixed-width columns allow for control over layouts desiring columns of various widths.
This helps appropriately present different content types and establish content hierarchy 
with wider columns for primary content and narrower for secondary content such as an 
[activity feed](/templates/dashboards#two-column-dashboard).

Mixed-width columns are specified in an array. The number of items in the array dictate the number of columns 
in the grid. 

For example, columns specified as `columns={[ 'small', 'xsmall', 'xsmall' ]}` would create a three 
column grid with corresponding widths: 

<Example
  horizontalLayout
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/MixedColumns1.js"
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
  height="auto"
>
  <MixedColumns1 />
</Example>

<br /><br />

And, `columns={[ '2/3', '1/3' ]}` would result in two columns with widths proportional 
to the total width of the grid:

<Example
  horizontalLayout
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/MixedColumns2.js"
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
  height="auto"
>
  <MixedColumns2 />
</Example>


#### Flexible Columns
Grid really shines when applying flexible columns. Flexible columns allow content to elegantly scale 
for dynamic designs.

With flexible columns, columns are defined as a min-max range. The column is 
allowed to flex as large as the max and as small as the min, depending on its content and the space 
available to the grid as a whole. This allows content to be consistently displayed in an organized 
and cohesive fashion across a variety of screen widths.

The min-max range is specified using a two-item array, instead of a single string. 
The first item is the min and second max.

```
// 3 columns. First and second columns are defined as min-max 
// ranges. The third, as a fixed width.

columns={[
  ['xxsmall', 'xsmall'], // column 1 is able to flex
  ['xsmall', 'small'],   // column 2 is able to flex
  'xsmall',              // column 3 is always 'xsmall'
]};
```

<Example
  horizontalLayout
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/MinMaxColumns1.js"
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
  height="auto"
>
  <MinMaxColumns1 />
</Example>

<br/><br/>

Using 'auto' and/or 'flex' as min-max values provides even more flexibility. 

'auto' and 'flex' share many characteristics. Both allow the column's width to be defined by its contents; 
they say, "make my column as wide as my content needs." If there is excess width in the grid, the column 
will stretch and occupy the excess space.

'auto' and 'flex' differ slightly in behavior when multiple columns are defined using their values:
- If multiple columns use 'auto', they share the excess width evenly.
- If multiple columns use 'flex', they share the excess width evenly.
- If 'auto' and 'flex' are both used, 'flex' will "win" the competition for the excess space. Columns 
defined with 'auto' will fit the dimensions of their contents; columns defined with 'flex', will fit 
the dimensions of their contents **and** occupy the excess width in the grid.

See `auto` and `flex` in action in the example below by adjusting your browser width, or applied in a [dashboard template](/templates/dashboards#two-column-dashboard).

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/MinMaxColumns2.js"
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
  height="auto"
  showResponsiveControls={['fullscreen']}
  overflow="auto"
>
  <MinMaxColumns2 />
</Example>

### Rows
Rows generally share the same properties as [columns](#columns). Accordingly, they won't be repeated here. 

That said, there a two primary items to call attention to:
1. Just like columns, rows are specified in an array. Each item in the array represent an additional row.
1. The vast majority of time rows will be specified using a fixed height, or as `auto` to let the row's height be defined by its 
contents.

### Gap

Use `gap` to define the spacing applied between columns and rows.

- As best practice, use [t-shirt sizing](/foundation/tshirt-sizing?q=gap#t-shirt-sizing-for-spacing-and-other-styles) 
to define gaps. T-shirt sizing keeps layouts consistent and easy to maintain.
- Gap may be applied to columns and rows, independently or simultaneously.

```
// both column gaps and rows gaps will be medium
gap="medium" 

// column and row gaps applied independently
gap={{ 
  column: 'medium', 
  row: 'xsmall'
}}

```

<Example
  horizontalLayout
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/GapExample.js"
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
  height="auto"
>
  <GapExample />
</Example>

## Implementing Grid
Grid is not limited to the following implementations. Approaches may be mixed and matched
as desired, but are presented with the intent to focus on the key concepts for each.

### Fluid Grids
Fluid grids allow the grid to grow and adapt to the grid's container width and the content provided. 

As more content is added, it fills the Grid left to right, top to bottom. Columns are added or removed as 
the screen's width is adjusted.

- Great for presenting dynamic content where the number of items in the grid are unknown. Examples might 
be applying filters to a catalog of services, presenting a dashboard where the user may customize the 
included widgets, or image results returned from a search query.
- Make responsive layouts easy to implement.
- Often implemented with [uniform columns](#uniform-columns).

The following example demonstrates a fluid grid consisting of 'small' columns. Adjust your browser's width 
and notice how the grid adjusts by adding/removing columns and rows.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/FluidGrid1.js"
  width="100%"
  height="auto"
>
  <FluidGrid1 />
</Example>

<br />
<br />

The contents within a grid's cells do not have to fill the cell. Grid's `align` and `justify` props may be applied 
to vertically and horizontally align the content within the cell as desired. Alternatively, an individual cell's 
content may be vertically aligned using its `alignSelf` prop.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/FluidGrid2.js"
  width="100%"
  height="auto"
>
  <FluidGrid2 />
</Example>

### Fixed Grid
When approaching a design or implementation, beginning with a fixed grid is a great approach as 
it lays a foundation from which you can build and refine.

  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/FixedGrid.js"

  height="auto"
>
