## Getting to know Grid
Grid is a powerful tool. It provides tremendous flexibility and control enabling designers and 
developers at HPE to create optimal user experiences at any screen size or resolution!

With all of Grid's power, there is a bit of a learning curve. The following introduces its key 
concepts and will accelerate your command of the tool.

### Background
Based on [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), 
Grommet's Grid simplifies and presents the API in a manner consistent with other components 
in the Grommet library.

Grid is composed of columns and rows and its properties allow for:
- Fixed column widths and row heights, when use cases desire precise dimensions for grid cells.
- Flexible column widths and heights, allowing grid cell contents to gracefully respond across 
a variety of browser widths.
- Fluid grids allowing columns and rows to grow and adapt to the content provided.
- Precise placement of elements within the grid via [areas](#areas).

## Grid Properties & Key Concepts
Grid's primary properties include: [columns](#columns), [rows](#rows), and [areas](#areas). The 
following examples will demonstrate how these properties may be applied to affect 
[content layouts](/templates/content-layouts).

### Columns
Columns may be specified as [uniform widths](#uniform-columns), [mixed widths](#mixed-width-columns), 
or as [min-max ranges](#flexible-columns) which allow the contents to flex gracefully.

#### Uniform Columns
Uniform columns are ideal for presenting a collection of like items such as a grid of images, 
a catalog of services, or a [dashboard of cards](/templates/dashboards#three-column-dashboard).

Specifying the column width as single string will repeat multiple columns of that size, as long as 
there is room for more. For example, `columns="medium"` will fit as many "medium" columns into the 
grid as the overall width allows. Within a wide screen, this might allow 3 or 4 columns; within a narrow 
screen, maybe only 1 or 2.

<Example
  horizontalLayout
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/UniformColumns.js"
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
>
  <UniformColumns />
</Example>

#### Mixed-Width Columns
Mixed-width columns allow for control over layouts desiring columns of various widths to appropriately present 
their contents, establish content hierarchy with wider columns for primary content and narrower for secondary 
content such as an [activity feed](/templates/dashboards#two-column-dashboard).

Mixed-width columns are specified in an array. The number of items in the array dictate the number of columns 
in the grid. 

For example, columns specified as `columns={[ 'small', 'xsmall', 'xsmall' ]}` would create a three 
column grid with corresponding widths: 

<Example
  horizontalLayout
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/MixedColumns1.js"
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
  height="auto"
>
  <MixedColumns1 />
</Example>

<br /><br />

And, `columns={[ '2/3', '1/3' ]}` would result in two columns with proportional 
widths:

<Example
  horizontalLayout
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/MixedColumns2.js"
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
  height="auto"
>
  <MixedColumns2 />
</Example>


#### Flexible Columns
Flexible columns is where Grid really shines. They allow content to elegantly scale and designs to be dynamic.

The main idea is defining columns as a min-max range. Between those bounds, the column is allowed to 
flex according to its content 
and the space available to the grid as a whole. This allows content to be consistently displayed in an 
organized and cohesive fashion across a variety of screen widths.

The min-max range is specified using a two-item array, instead of a single string. 
The first item is the min and second max.

```
// 3 columns. First and second columns are defined as min-max 
// ranges. The third, as a fixed width.

columns={[
  ['small', 'medium'], // column 1 is able to flex
  ['medium', 'large'], // column 2 is able to flex
  'small',             // column 3 is always 'small'
]};
```

<Example
  horizontalLayout
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/MinMaxColumns1.js"
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
  height="auto"
>
  <MinMaxColumns1 />
</Example>

<br/><br/>

Using `auto` and/or `flex` as min-max values provides even more flexibility:

 - 'auto' allows the 
column's width to be defined by its contents; it says, "make 
my column as wide as my content needs."
- 'flex' allows the column to grow and fill the any excess width in the grid. If multiple columns use 
`flex`, they share the excess width evenly.

See `auto` and `flex` in action in the example below by adjusting your browser width, or applied in a [dashboard template](/templates/dashboards#two-column-dashboard).

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/MinMaxColumns2.js"
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
  height="auto"
  showResponsiveControls={['fullscreen']}
  overflow="auto"
>
  <MinMaxColumns2 />
</Example>

### Rows
Rows generally share the same properties as [columns](#columns). Accordingly, they won't be repeated here. 

That said, there a two primary items to call out:
1. Just like columns, rows are specified in an array. Each item in the array represent an additional row.
1. The vast majority of time rows will be specified using a fixed height, or as `auto` to let the row's height be defined by its 
contents.

### Gap

Use `gap` to define the spacing applied between columns and rows.

As best practice, use [t-shirt sizing](/foundation/tshirt-sizing?q=gap#t-shirt-sizing-for-spacing-and-other-styles) 
to define gaps, that keeps layouts consistent and easier to implement and maintain.

Gap may be applied to columns and rows, independently or simulatneously.

```
// both column gaps and rows gaps will be medium
gap="medium" 

// column and row gaps applied independently
gap={{ 
  column: 'medium', 
  row: 'xsmall'
}}

```

<Example
  horizontalLayout
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/GapExample.js"
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
  height="auto"
>
  <GapExample />
</Example>

## Implementing Grid
The following implementations are not mutually exclusive. They may be mixed and matched
as desired, but are presented with the intent to focus on the key concepts for each approach.

### Fluid Grids

### Fixed Grid
When approaching a design or implementation, beginning with a fixed grid is a great approach as 
it lays a foundation from which you can build and refine.

A fixed grid

  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/feat-2381-grid-docs/aries-site/src/examples/components/grid/FixedGrid.js"

  <FixedGrid />
