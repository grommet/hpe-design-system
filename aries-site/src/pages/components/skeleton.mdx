### When to use
Skeletons are used on all pages to provide a visual layout of the content being loaded.  They help users perceive a loading period as being shorter in duration.

### When not to use
Skeletons should not be used if:
- The data or elements being loaded are unknown.
- The user is awaiting feedback for in-context actions such as submitting a form or fetching search results.
  - The Spinner component may be more appropriate.
- The loading process takes more than a few minutes to load.
  - Pair with a message or notification to provide the user with better visibility of a systemâ€™s status.

### Anatomy

<Example plain>
  <SkeletonAnatomy />
</Example>


Skeletons come in three different shapes - circular, rounded, and rectangular. The shape, size, and elevation of a Skeleton are all dependent on the UI elements that are loading. 
Grommet has added `skeleton` property in order to make it easy to switch between a skeleton state and data-rich state for a variety of components.
The components that currently support skeleton are:
- Text, Paragraph, Heading
- Button
- Box, Card, Pageheader, Footer, Header
