### When to use
- The interface is content-rich and has asynchronous loading, in order to provide the user with a sense of the page structure and to minimize layout shifts when content is loaded in.

### When not to use
- The user is awaiting feedback for in-context actions such as fetching search results. Use a [Spinner](/components/spinner) instead.
- The user is awaiting feedback on a submission process, like submitting a form. Use a [Busy Button](/components/button#busy-button) instead.

### Anatomy

<Example plain>
  <SkeletonAnatomy />
</Example>


Skeletons come in three different shapes - circular, rounded, and rectangular. The shape, size, and elevation of a Skeleton are all dependent on the UI elements that are loading. 
Grommet has added `skeleton` property in order to make it easy to switch between a skeleton state and data-rich state for a variety of components.
The components that currently support skeleton are:
- Text, Paragraph, Heading
- Button
- Box, Card, Pageheader, Footer, Header
