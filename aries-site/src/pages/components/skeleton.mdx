## Use cases

Loading data collections, such as:
- Tables
- Lists
- Cards
- Dashboards

<Example>
  <DashboardChartsExample />
</Example>

Loading dashboard content where contents may be fetched from a variety of services, such as:
- User profiles
- Notifications
- Messages
- Activity feeds
- Chart summaries

### Use When
- Waiting for content to be returned and displayed to a user, to provide a sense of page structure and minimize layout shifts.

#### Don't Use When
- Indicating the status for an ongoing activity where the result will be success or failure. Use [Busy Button](/components/button?q=button#busy-buttonn), [Spinner](/components/spinner) or Progress Bar (coming soon) instead.

### Anatomy

<Example plain>
  <SkeletonAnatomy />

### Variants

Skeletons come in three different shapes - circular, rounded, and rectangular. The shape, size, and elevation of a Skeleton are all dependent on the UI elements that are loading. 
Grommet has added `skeleton` property in order to make it easy to switch between a skeleton state and data-rich state for a variety of components.
The components that currently support skeleton are:
- Text, Paragraph, Heading
- Button
- Box, Card, Pageheader, Footer, Header

### Accessibility

Skeletons are not meant to be interactive, and should not receive focus. They should only be used to 
indicate loading states. Ensure that screen readers are informed of the loading state by using `aria-live` 
attributes. For example, you can use `aria-live="polite"` to announce loading states to screen readers.

### Best Practices

- Use Skeletons to provide a visual cue to users that content is loading.
- Avoid using Skeletons for long periods of time, as they can lead to confusion if users are left waiting without feedback.
- Ensure that the transition from Skeleton to actual content is smooth to enhance user experience.
- Consider using a combination of Skeletons and other loading indicators (like spinners) for better user feedback.

### Conclusion

Skeletons are a useful tool for improving user experience during loading states. They provide a visual 
representation of the content structure, helping users understand what to expect while waiting for 
data to load. By following best practices and accessibility guidelines, you can effectively implement 
Skeletons in your applications.
