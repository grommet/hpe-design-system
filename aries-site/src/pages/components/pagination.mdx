## When to use

{/* WHY - Describe the user problem being solved and the benefit here. */}

Use pagination when a user's goal is to find a specific item rather than to browse 
the full set of data. Breaking the data up into smaller, consistently sized chunks 
allow users to easily jump to specific sections of the data or examine subsets.

If the user will be scrolling and browsing large amounts of the data set, consider 
using [Infinite Scroll](https://v2.grommet.io/infinitescroll).

Pagination is particularly effective for displaying large data collections presented
as [tables](#paginated-table), [lists](#paginated-list), or [cards](#paginated-cards).

## Anatomy

{/* WHAT - Specify the parts of the component or pattern (i.e. what makes up) and why 
they exist (i.e. purpose / benefit to the user). */}

```js
provide anatomy diagram here
```

| Label | Region | Purpose | Required | Notes |
| :---: | ------ | ------- | :------: | ----- |
| **1** | **Container** | Organizes the pagination regions, their placement, spacing, and how they respond when space is limited. <br /><br /> Provides visual containment for functionally related elements via proximity, background, borders, etc.. | <Checkmark a11yTitle="true" size="small" /> | |
| **2** | **Page summary** | Context region displaying the range of results being viewed. Provides the user assurance by communicating the subset of results displayed. | Optional | |
| **3** | **Step size selector** | Customization region allowing users to modify the number of items per page to their preferenc. | Optional | Step size options may be customized using [stepOptions](https://v2.grommet.io/pagination#stepOptions). |
| **4** | **Pagination controls** | Navigation region allowing user to jump to records of interest. | <Checkmark a11yTitle="true" size="small" /> | The number of middle and edge pages are configurable using [Pagination props](https://v2.grommet.io/pagination#props). Useful for scenarios when horizontal real-estate may be limited. |

## Behaviors

{/* HOW - Describe how this component behaves considering interactive states, data 
states, available real-estate, and motion. */}

{/* Interactivity - focus, hover, selection, down, drag, disabled, etc. */}

{/* Data states - loading, error, empty, has value, missing values, etc. */}

{/* Real-estate - responsive, fluid, fixed, overflow, truncation, etc. */}
### Responsive

```javascript
add responsive example here
```

{/* Motion - speed, easing, delay, etc. */}

{/* Animation - duration, easing, direction, etc. */}

## Usage

{/* HOW - Describe how to use this component or pattern and when and how its variants 
can/should be applied. */}

### Options

{/* How this component may be configured by variants, styles, sizing, orientation, 
states, decoration, placement, etc. */}

#### Number of results per page

The default number of records per page should be tailored to the data set and determined 
by the UX designer. For example, a data collection displaying log files or notifications 
may choose a large page size allowing a user to scan and understand activity in an 
efficient manner. Whereas, a data collection presenting items in a news feed or 
resource cards presenting products and services may only need to present a handful of 
records at a time.

The UX objective is to find a balance between providing a user enough information to 
consume and/or find records of interest without being too much information leading to 
cognitive overload.

- Choose a reasonable default page size. For tables, a reasonable starting point is 20-25 records.
- Let users choose their own page size preference by providing a step size selector.
- If there is only one page of items expected, it is optional to display the pagination 
component and page summary.

```javascript
add stepOptions example here
```

### Showing summary of results

{/* revisit content from here and below */}
It may be beneficial to provide users with a summary of what range of results 
they are viewing. This should take the format of "Showing x-y of z" where x is 
the start of the page, y is the end of the page, and z is the total number of 
records. This should be left-aligned in a row with the pagination component.

The results summary should be justified to the start of the row and the pagination 
component should remain justified to the end of the row.

```javascript
add summary example here
```

### Placement of pagination component

The pagination component should be placed underneath and justified to the end of the 
content it is paginating.

## Use case examples

In addition to [DataTable](/components/datatable#paginated) and [List](/templates/lists#paginated), here is another way pagination can be implemented.

### Paginated table

Tables often contain large amounts of data. To improve the efficiency that a user can navigate to a specific item or range of items, use pagination.

<ExampleImagePreview
  label="See Paginated Table"
  href="/components/datatable#paginated"
  src="/pagination-table-preview.png"
  alt="HPE Design System Paginated Table Example"
/>

### Paginated list

Lists often contain large amounts of data. To improve the efficiency that a user can navigate to a specific item or range of items, use pagination.

<ExampleImagePreview
  label="See Paginated List"
  href="/templates/lists#paginated"
  src="/pagination-list-preview.png"
  alt="HPE Design System Paginated List Example"
/>

### Paginated cards

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/pagination/PaginationCardsExample.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/pagination?theme=hpe#props"
  showResponsiveControls={['laptop', 'mobile']}
  template
>
  <PaginationCardsExample />
</Example>

## Accessibility

{/* List and describe relevant keyboard interations, announcements, ARIA attributes, 
internationalization considerations and/or requirements. */}

Below are some accessibility requirements that ensure pagination is accessible 
for assisstive technologies and keyboard navigation.

If your team is developing with Grommet, these considerations are already handled, 
so no further action is required from your team.

1. Wrap pagination links in a `<nav>` element.
1. Provide an `aria-label="pagination navigaton"` and `role="navigation"`.
1. Individual page buttons should have an `aria-label` that reads "Go to page X", 
where X is the page that will be navigated to upon selection.
1. The active page button should have `aria-current="true"`.
1. The next/previous arrow buttons should have `aria-label` that reads "Go to next page" 
and "Go to previous page", respectively.

For more detailed documentation on these requirements, you can read more about 
[accessible pagination](https://www.a11ymatters.com/pattern/pagination/).
