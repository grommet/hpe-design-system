### When to use
Skeletons are used when:
- Loading elements are known ahead of time but are not immediately available.
- All of the content on a page is loaded in at the same time.
- Users are loading high-traffic pages, such as a user dashboard.

### When not to use
Skeletons should not be used if:
- The data or elements being loaded are unknown.
- The user is awaiting feedback for in-context actions such as submitting a form or fetching search results.
  - The Spinner component may be more appropriate.
