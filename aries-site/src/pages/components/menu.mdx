## Guidance

A Menu is a set of actions that may be used to engage with content on a page or to navigate to other pages. When a menu item is clicked, the action will be executed.

Menu should not be confused with [Select](/components/select). Though visually similar, Select is often used in the context of a Form and used to choose from a set of values rather than actions.

### Usage

To create a predictable experience for users, the following are guidelines for using Menu.

**It is recommended that you do not have more than 5 items in a menu.** In order to create the most effective user experience, keep the number of items to a minimum. This allows the user to easily understand the scope of the actions they can perform.

**Give the menu a clear title.** Instead of labeling the menu as "Menu", provide a name that conveys its purpose. For example, a label of "Account Information" would be appropriate if the menu items associated were actions such as "Change username" or "Reset password".

**Keep labels short.** Using a simple, concise label for menu items, such as "Settings" or "Logout", helps the user easily understand the action that will be performed when they click. Longer labels may clutter the layout and create a more effortful experience for the user.

**Avoid creating cascading menus.** Menus with multiple layers creates a confusing experience for the user because relevant actions may become nested and difficult to find. Refining menu items to necessary actions creates a more manageable user experience.

## Organizing menu items

Allow a user to quickly locate the menu item they desire by organizing menu items
through thoughtful ordering and grouping.

### Guiding principles

- Make it easy for the user to scan by grouping related items and placing more
  frequently used actions at the top of the menu.
- Ensure intentionality, by placing destructive actions in a distinct, consistent
  location at the end of the menu.

### Grouping

Group related menu items. Use separator lines to create visually distinct groups
of related menu items.

Create separate groups for menu items initiating actions and items setting
attributes. Menu items become unpredictable when the behavior of grouped items
varies.

Menu items should only be grouped if there are two or more related items.

<BestPracticeGroup>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message:
        'Leave actions in a single group when there is only 1 menu item in each category.',
    }}
  >
    {/* Box allows menu to be presented with drop open, overriding Example align/justify center */}
    <Box height="xsmall">
      <MenuGroupingExample />
    </Box>
  </Example>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don't add a separator between groups when there is only 1 menu item in 
      each category. A single dangerous actions is the exception and should be placed 
      in a distinct group.`,
    }}
  >
    {/* Box allows menu to be presented with drop open, overriding Example align/justify center */}
    <Box height="xsmall">
      <MenuGroupingExample bestPractice={false} />
    </Box>
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

### Ordering

Frequency of use should guide the order in which menu items are presented.

When menu items are grouped, order items within that group by frequency.
Additionally, place the most frequently used group at the top of the menu.
This anticipates what the user is looking for and allows them to locate the
item as their eye scans the items top to bottom.

Exception: [Dangerous actions](#dangerous-actions) should be placed as the
last item in the menu.

### Dangerous actions

Dangerous or destructive actions altering a state which cannot
be recovered, such as delete, should be placed as the last item in the menu
with a visual separator for the dangerous actions grouping so that they are
distinct from all other actions.

Selecting a dangerous action should lead to double confirmation.

<BestPracticeGroup>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message:
        'Always separate a dangerous action into its own group and place it at the end. Clicking on a dangerous action should lead to a double confirmation.',
    }}
  >
    {/* Box allows menu to be presented with drop open, overriding Example align/justify center */}
    <Box height="small">
      <MenuDangerousExample />
    </Box>
  </Example>
  <Example
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don't leave dangerous actions grouped with other actions. Don't apply the dangerous action without double confirmation.`,
    }}
  >
    {/* Box allows menu to be presented with drop open, overriding Example align/justify center */}
    <Box height="small">
      <MenuDangerousExample bestPractice={false} />
    </Box>
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

### Common groupings in HPE applications

Many HPE applications provide the ability for customers to configure, modify,
and act upon resources in their environment.

For applications in this context, groups of menu items can be thought of as
[configuring](#configuring), [executing](#executing), or [transferring](#transferring).

#### Configuring

Actions allowing a user to set and modify attributes of a resource.

- View [resource] details
- Edit [resource]
- Add [item] to [resource]
- Remove [item] from [resource]
- Assign [resource] to [another resource]
- Add [resource] to group

#### Executing

Actions providing the ability for a user to act upon a resource.

- Launch [resource]
- Power on/off [resource]
- Reset [resource]
- Update/upgrade software/firmware version for [resource]

#### Transferring

Actions enabling a user to share or consume data related to a resource.

- Download [resource] data
- Share [resource] with [user]
- Send [resource] to [user]
- Notify [user] about [resource]

#### Batch actions menu related to a selection of servers

The table menu's batch actions are grouped by executing and configuration actions.
The executing actions group is ordered first because the actions in it are the
most frequently used.

<Example
  code={[
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/menu/MenuBatchActionsExample.js',
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/FilterControls/FilterControls.js',
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/data/mockData/servers.json',
  ]}
  github="https://github.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/blob/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/menu/MenuBatchActionsExample.js"
  height={{ min: 'small' }}
>
  <MenuBatchActionsExample />
</Example>

#### Actions menu related to an individual record

Each server group has a menu whose actions have been grouped by configuration,
executing, and dangerous actions. The configuration actions group is ordered first
because adjusting and viewing the group are the most frequently used. The delete
group action is ordered last since deleting the group is a destructive action and
cannot be recovered.

<Example
  code={[
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/menu/MenuRecordActionsExample.js',
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/data/mockData/serverGroups.json',
  ]}
  github="https://github.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/blob/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/menu/MenuRecordActionsExample.js"
  height={{ min: 'medium' }}
>
  <MenuRecordActionsExample />
</Example>

## Variants

There are various places a Menu may be useful within an application. If the user is going to be selecting from a list of options to execute an action, Menu is a good component to use. The usage of labels and icons allow a menu to be versatile for different layout contexts.

### Within a header

A menu can be used in a [Header](/components/header) to group related actions.
The default Menu should be used in all instances unless the Menu is contained within a toolbar, in which case see [Menu within a toolbar](#within-a-toolbar) guidance.

<Example
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/menu?theme=hpe#props"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/menu/MenuHeaderExample.js"
  height={{ min: 'small' }}
  width="100%"
>
  <MenuHeaderExample />
</Example>

### Within a toolbar

Use `kind="toolbar"` when the Menu is placed in row with other toolbar controls like search or filter.
In this situation, a search input, filter button, and action menu are presented as a unified set of controls. The intent is to present each control with equal prominence.

<Example
  code={[
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/button/ToolbarButtonExample.js',
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/FilterControls/FilterControls.js',
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/FilterControls/Filters.js',
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/FilterControls/ResultsSummary.js',
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/FilterControls/SearchFilter.js',
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/FilterControls/FiltersContext.js',
  ]}
  github="https://github.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/blob/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/button/ToolbarButtonExample.js"
  height={{ min: 'small' }}
  width="100%"
>
  <ToolbarButtonExample />
</Example>

### With custom icon

Adding an icon prop changes the icon that appears on the menu. In some contexts, it may be appropriate to use a more specific or alternate icon. Here is an example Menu being used in a [List](/templates/lists) to indicate actions that can be performed on list items.

<Example
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/menu?theme=hpe#props"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/menu/MenuIconExample.js"
  height={{ min: 'small' }}
  width="100%"
>

  <MenuIconExample />
</Example>

### Disabled

Used to indicate that a Menu cannot be interacted with.

<Example
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/menu?theme=hpe#props"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/menu/MenuDisabledExample.js"
  height={{ min: 'small' }}
>
  <MenuDisabledExample />
</Example>

## Accessibility

Accessibility features such as screen reader messages are automatically built into Menu. By default, these messages are "Open Menu" and "Close Menu". However, if a more specific message is necessary, a custom [a11yTitle](https://v2.grommet.io/menu?theme=hpe#a11yTitle) or [messages](https://v2.grommet.io/menu?theme=hpe#messages) may be applied.

An icon may be used on a menu item to provide additional context about the action. It is recommended that an icon is used in conjunction with text to ensure the context of the menu item is clear. However, there may be cases where an icon alone is sufficient. For example, highly familiar action indicators, such as this example of [Menu with custom icon](#with-custom-icon) demonstrate when an icon only may be sufficient.
