## Guidance

FileInput is a specialized input that provides the user with a means of selecting a file or files for upload.

### Usage

- User must be able to upload a file by clicking the "Select File" button, dragging and dropping a file over the drop region, or tabbing to the FileInput and pressing the Spacebar or Enter key.
- When FileInput is in a Form, the file should not be uploaded/saved to a server until the user has submitted the form.
- Once a file has been added to the input, a button featuring a Trash icon will appear next to the file name allowing removal of that file.
- The "Select File" button should always be visible, allowing the user to add more files/replace a file after they have already selected one.

For additional configurations, such as defining accepted file type, all instrinsic HTML properties are supported. For a comprehensive list of these options, you can read more about [HTML input type="file"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file).

### Accessibility

When using FileInput within a Form, the FormField wrapping the FileInput should have `htmlFor` and `name` properties that match the `id` and `name` properties placed onto the FileInput. See the [FileInput within a Form example](/templates/forms#required-and-optional-fields) for reference on how to implement.

## Variants

FileInputs can be used as a single file upload or multiple files.

### FileInput with multiple files

To allow multiple files to be uploaded, add the prop `multiple`.
