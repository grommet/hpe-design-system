## Guidance

Tags are simple attributes containing metadata:

- Simple, brief and concise metadata to describe a resource or content
- Included in search, filter, and in the details of a resource
- Organize and group resources by common characteristics or attibutes
- Assisst batch actions and selection of multiple resources

## Anatomy

The most basic tags consist of two primary elements:

<Example plain caption="Diagram illustrating the primary elements of a tag." >
  <TagBasicAnatomy />
</Example>

1. Border
1. Name

Tags can have additional elements depending on the tagsâ€™ intended use and context:

<Example plain>
  <TagAnatomy />
</Example>

1. Border
1. Name
1. Value
1. Close icon

Character requirements:

- Name : 1-128 characters
- Value : 1-256 characters
- Unlimited unique names for an account

### The Close Icon

Applying the close icon is dependent upon the use case and not a requirement.

<Example height="xsmall" horizontalLayout>
  <FormClose />
</Example>

When to use the close icon:

1. Removing a tag in an editor
1. Removing a tag as filtering criteria
1. Use cases that require the clearing or removal of a tag from a resource

When the close icon should not be used:

1. Displaying tags for a resource in a detail view
1. Displaying tags where removal of the tag is not within an edit experience for the resource

## Name-Value Pairs

Name-Value pairing with tags allow further organization and identification of resources. While this feature is not a requirement, name-value pairs can help users more clearly group resources.

### Creating Name-Value Pair Tags

The experience for creating a Name-Value pair tag occurs in 2 steps: Create the name and then create the value. Alternatively, select an existing name and create a new value.

## Assigning Tags

Currently, assigning tags occurs within an editor experience in a modal or wizard. This helps to focus the task for the user. Tags are first selected and/or created, then assigned to the resource.

## Filtering with Tags

Filtering tags allows the user to search, select and remove tags. Tags do not appear in the UI to allow for a clean, task-based UI, as well as to not confuse the experience with other filtering criteria.

One example in which a tag can be used to facilitate quick associations amongst resources is to use the tag as a clickable filter from the detail of resource.
