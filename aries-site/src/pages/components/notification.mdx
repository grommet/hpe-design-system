## What are they for?

Notifications build trust by providing users confidence and assurance that they are informed with timely, relevant status about their systems and tasks.

## Taxonomy

To standardize language for notifications across HPE projects, be sure to familiarize yourself with this taxonomy:

- **Type** - In the broadest terms, what the notification is about
- **State** - The current stage within a process
- **Status** - The condition of a process
- **Attention level** - The priority and importance of a notification
- **Actions** - Interactactions within a notification
- **Persistence** - How the notification is dismissed
- **Placement** - Where the notification can be found
- **Insight** - The content of the notification

<TaxonomyTable />

### State vs. status vs. health

A state is the current stage of a process.

A status is the condition of the state. Status can also be thought of as a pointer to a state’s “health.” At HPE we tend to use the two terms interchangeably, but the end users don't know that. To avoid confusion for the end user, do not use the word "health" in your user interfaces. Always use "status" instead.

Here is an example of a toast notification that illustrates their differences:

<StateVsStatusDiagram />

Keep in mind that a status **derives** from a state.

## Notification systems

The following types of notifications are used to provide users with full transparent clarity on tasks and system statuses:

- [Status Indicators](/templates/status-indicator) are used within all types of notifications. They capture a user’s attention based on the notification’s level of severity.
- For low priority and non-action-oriented notifications, [Toast Notifications](/templates/toast-notifications) are a great way to inform users unobtrusively.

## Variants

There are a couple types of the notification component depending on use case.

### Toast notification

Toast notifications are used for low attention status messages or updates that do not require user action. For more thorough guidance on how and when to properly make use of a toast, access the full page on [Toast Notifications](/templates/toast-notifications).

<Example
  componentName="Notification"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/toast-notifications/ToastNotificationExample.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/notification"
  grommetSource="https://github.com/grommet/grommet/blob/master/src/js/components/Notification/Notification.js"
>
  <ToastNotificationExample />
</Example>

### Global banner notification

Global banner notifications are system-generated alerts that attract the user's attention to system conditions and updates. For more thorough guidance on how and when to properly make use of a global banner, access the full page on [Global Banner Notifications](/templates/global-banner-notifications).

<Example
  componentName="Notification"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/global-banner-notifications/Examples/ToastNotificationExample.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/notification"
  grommetSource="https://github.com/grommet/grommet/blob/master/src/js/components/Notification/Notification.js"
  height={{ min: 'small' }}
  width="100%"
>
  <BannerNotificationCritical />
</Example>

### Inline notification

Inline notifications are messages that appear near the content to which they are related. For more thorough guidance, read [inline notifications documentation](/templates/inline-notifications).

<Example
  code={[
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/inline-notifications/InlineNotificationExample.js',
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-core/src/js/components/layouts/ButtonGroup/ButtonGroup.js',
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-core/src/js/components/layouts/ModalDialog/ModalDialog.js',
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-core/src/js/components/typography/TextEmphasis.js',
  ]}
  github="https://github.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/blob/master/aries-site/src/examples/templates/inline-notifications/InlineNotificationExample.js"
  showResponsiveControls={['fullScreen']}
  screenContainer
  width="100%"
>
  <InlineNotificationExample />
</Example>

### Roadmap

- Page banner
- System
- Inline
- Notification center
- Badging & bell
