        <Text>
          In Latin, Aries means ram. In Greek Mythology, Aries is the symbol of
          the ram responsible for the golden fleece too Poseidon and is a symbol
          of authority and kingship. HPE translates these themes into agility,
          preparedness, responsibiltiy, and resolute performance above all else.

          best practices to succeed when using HPEâ€™s Design Language for your

        <Subheading>What HPE Aries is not</Subheading>
        <Text>
          This library is not just a brand or style guide, it is a living
          breathing animal. It is not just a list of list of assets or a design
          file. Aries does not provide solutions for all.
