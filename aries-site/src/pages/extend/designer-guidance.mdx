## Getting started

We're excited you're using the HPE Design System! Below are a set of resources that will help you get started using the HPE Design System components in your designs. If you don't find what you're looking for, please reach out in the #hpe-design-system channel on [Slack](/https://grommet.slack.com).

### Setting up your Figma account

If you are new to Figma, the [Figma Getting Started](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002051613-Getting-Started) page is a good place to start.

[Create a Figma account](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039811114-Create-a-Figma-account) with your HPE email address. Using your HPE email provides immediate access to all HPE Design System files.

If you would prefer to access the HPE Design System library in a desktop app, you can download the [Figma Desktop App](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039823654-Download-the-Figma-Desktop-App#Download_the_Desktop_App) for MacOS or Windows.

### Joining the HPE Design System Figma team

Once you have made a Figma account with your HPE email, you can request to join the HPE Design System team. You can do so by following these steps:

1. Log into Figma and look for an HPE icon in your left control bar.
2. Click on HPE. Here, you will see all HPE Figma teams.
3. Look for "HPE Design System" and click "Request to join".

Once you have been added to this team, you will have access to all of the HPE Design System files.

### Before your start designing

Familiarize yourself with the concepts and components the HPE Design System offers. The [HPE Design System sticker sheet](https://www.figma.com/file/ItdN5pNBubFpV8GP5RowY3/HPE-Component-Sticker-Sheet?node-id=58%3A40) is a great place to get an overview of what the design system offers.

Understanding use cases and guidelines for individual components will ensure your designs align with the HPE Design System.

### HPE Design System Figma Library

The [HPE Design System sticker sheet](https://www.figma.com/file/ItdN5pNBubFpV8GP5RowY3/HPE-Component-Sticker-Sheet?node-id=58%3A40) provides a foundation for designing HPE applications. The sticker sheet provides an overview of the components contained within the Design System library.

To access individual files for each component, navigate to the HPE Design System Figma team. If you are having trouble accessing the files, you may need to [join the HPE Design System Figma team](#joining-the-hpe-design-system-figma-team) first.

Each component has its own library file that demonstrates the various states of the component such as enabled, disabled, hover, active, and focus. The examples within these files can be leveraged within your design files and are built to be interactive and responsive.
