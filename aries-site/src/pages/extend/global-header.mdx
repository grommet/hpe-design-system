## Guidelines

The Global Header is a standardized header to be used across applications. The styling should be implemented as is demonstrated in these examples.

## What makes up the Global Header?

### Menu + App Identity

The Menu and App Identity are interactive elements whose presence and look are dependent on if the user is logged in. Follow the guidance below.

**If user is logged in:**

- Menu button is present and opens a Sidebar Layer containing additional navigation options. This Layer should have modal={false} applied to ensure users can continue to interact with the underlying page content.
- App Identity has a text value of either "HPE Service Name" or "Aruba Service Name".
- HPE/Aruba has weight="bold" and Service Name has default weight. When clicked, this should route to the home page of the application.

**If user is not logged in:**

- Menu button is not present since in-app navigation is not an option.
- App Identity has text value of "Hewlett Packward Enterprise" with weight="bold". When clicked, this should route to [ WHERE ? ].

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/extend/global-header/AppIdentity.js"
  horizontalLayout
  height="none"
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
>
  <AppIdentityExample />
</Example>

### Header Nav

The header navigation items should only be present if a user is logged in. This section contains three buttons: help information, home, and user avatar.

1. The **Help button** links to [ WHERE? ].
1. The **Home button** routes to the homepage of the application.
1. The **Avatar button** opens additional options regarding the active account.
   - If a user has a profile picture, this should appear in the avatar. Otherwise, their first and last initials should appear.
   - On click, a drop should open containing the user's name and email. The footer of the drop contains a "My Profile" button which routes to the user's profile page and a "Sign Out" button which signs the user out and routes back to the Sign In page.

  height="none"
