## What is t-shirt sizing?

T-shirt sizing uses semantic names (a.k.a. design tokens) which map familiar clothing sizes (`small`, `medium`, `large`, etc.) to specific pixel values for sizing and spacing.
T-shirt sizes apply to:
- [Spacing](/foundation/spacing) (padding, margin, gap)
- [Content containers](/foundation/content-container-sizes) (width, height, border, radius)
- [Components](/foundation/component-sizes) (size property)

Use t-shirt sizes rather than hard pixel values. If a new value is needed, report 
it so it can be added as a design token.

## Benefits

T-shirt sizes promote consistency, systematic UI delivery, and ensure harmony among 
layout elements. Hardcoded and arbitrary pixel values should be avoided, as they are 
inflexible and fail to realize the benefits provided by t-shirt sizes, including:

- Establish shared vocabulary across designers, developers, and delivery teams.
- Accelerate layout specification through reuse of predefined values.
- Ensure UIs are composable using common, shared size definitions.
- Facilitate responsive design.
- Enable density modes and expanded user preferences.
- Promote consistency, maintainability, and scalability through systematic reuse.

## Responsiveness

Layouts should be designed with responsiveness in mind to meet a user wherever they are &mdash; whether on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.

The values of semantic spacing and radius design tokens step down in size at the `small` [breakpoint](/design-tokens/global#breakpoint). This retains appropriate proportions between shape, spacing, and content as the screen size decreases.

When utilizing the CSS files, a media query is included in the `dimension.small.css` file to adjust the token values at the `small` breakpoint.

To further refine layouts for different screen sizes, various [breakpoints](/design-tokens/global#breakpoint) can be used to instruct logic for layout adjustments.
