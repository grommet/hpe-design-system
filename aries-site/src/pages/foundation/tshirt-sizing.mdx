The proximity and grouping of elements establish a clear content hierarchy that facilitates a user in accomplishing their goals, free of distraction.

Layouts should be:

- **Responsive**: They should adapt to different screen sizes and device types.
- **Consistent**: They should maintain a predictable structure across the application.
- **Semantic**: They should be designed with HTML semantics in mind to ensure accessibility.

## What is t-shirt sizing?

T-shirt sizing is the way that Grommet leverages familiar clothing sizes of "small", "medium", "large", and other ranges of sizes to drive the sizing and spacing of components. Grommet maps these t-shirt sizes to specific pixel values. The mapping and pixel value derivation is [explained below](/foundation/tshirt-sizing#the-base-unit).

T-shirt sizing controls two aspects of a user interface:

- the [height and width](/foundation/tshirt-sizing#t-shirt-sizing-for-component-dimensions) of layout components
- the [spacing](/foundation/tshirt-sizing#t-shirt-sizing-for-spacing-and-other-styles) within and around components (e.g. gap, margin, padding, border, etc.)

When designing and developing with the HPE Design System, you should always use t-shirt sizes. If you find yourself specifying custom pixel values, this should be a warning signaling either:

- A need to consult with your designer about why a custom value is needed.
- Something in the implementation can and should be simplified.
- Or, there could be a gap in the Design System which should be reported and addressed.

In nearly every case, designs and development should be using t-shirt sizes for compatibility and maintenance.

## Why do we use t-shirt sizing?

T-shirt sizing delivers a more unified experience for HPE customers by creating consistent user interfaces across pages and across applications.

There are also benefits of t-shirt sizing for designers and developers!

T-shirt sizing creates a common language between designers and developers, as well as provides common, well-defined intervals which make designing and developing more efficient.

Using pixel values, percentages, or other sizing methods to create layouts can result in applications that are less composable and less scalable. Instead, a container of content may just have a width of "medium", for example, and Grommet will take care of the rest.

Finally, t-shirt sizes enable content to responsively scale more easily and consistently. For example, a layout's padding may be set to "large" on desktop screen and gracefully adjust to "small" on mobile devices with minimal effort.

## The base unit

In order to create the range of sizes and their corresponding pixel values, a base unit of `24px` is used as a scalar. This creates a proportional scale where sizes relate to one another in predictable ways.

## Foundational scale

The following sizing scale has been built from the following principles:

- **Proportional**: Have a natural ratio where each step in the scale is proportional to other steps.
- **Composable**: Each scale step may is divisible into have, thirds, quarters, etc. Alternatively each step is composable from smaller steps.
- **Flexible**: Scale may be divided into subsets and provides choice serving a variety of use cases.

The sizing scale consists of a primary scale based on the doubling/halving of a 24px base unit and a supplementary scale doubling/halving a 16px base unit.

The resulting scale steps: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 192, 256, 384, 512, 768, 1024, 1536.

Spacing, container, radius, and borderWidth tokens are defined using subsets of this scale.

## T-shirt sizing for component dimensions

One of the main ways t-shirt sizing is used is to control the width/height of a component. For some components, like [Box](/components/box), this can be controlled with the `width` and `height` props. For other components, like [Avatar](https://v2.grommet.io/avatar?theme=hpe), [DataTable](/components/datatable), or [Text](/foundation/typography#text), the dimensions are controlled by the `size` prop. And others, like [Grid](/components/grid), t-shirt sizes specify `row` and `column` dimensions.

The [Grommet site](https://v2.grommet.io/) provides documentation on the props available to any given component. If you're unsure if a component supports `width`, `height`, or `size`, that would be the right place to check.

For example, if you were to implement the following code, you would have a Box with width of "medium" (384px) and height of "small" (192px).

```
<Box width="medium" height="small" />
```

<Box width="large">
  <Image src="/box-sizing.png" alt="Demonstration of t-shirt sizing on Box" />
</Box>

## T-shirt sizing for spacing and other styles

In addition to overall component dimensions, t-shirt sizing can also be used to define spacing and other styling such as pad, gap, margin, and border.

Spacing uses proximity principles to define relationships between content and create hierarchy within a page. Spacing design tokens define the padding within, margin around, or gap between content.

Spacing guides users' eyes through the page, helping them understand the relationships between different elements. The HPE Design System minimizes use of borders to separate content. Instead spacing, typography, and background color are combined to create visual hierarchy

There are 12 spacing tokens to provide flexibility to cater to various design needs ranging from dense data-rich experiences to more spacious layouts.

To create the pixel values for these styles, Grommet divides and/or multiplies the base unit of `24px` by various integers. This creates a consistent system where spacing values are proportional and harmonious.

For example, if you were to implement the following code, you would have a Box with width of medium, height of small, and pad of large.

```
<Box
    width="medium"
    height="small"
    pad="large"
/>
```

<Box width="medium" margin={{bottom: 'large'}}>
  <Image
    src="/edge-sizing.png"
    alt="Demonstration of t-shirt sizing for pad on Box"
  />
</Box>

### Spacing best practices

<BestPracticeGroup>
  <Example
    height="none"
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message:
        'Use spacing design tokens to style compositional or layout components like cards, layers, and grid spacing.',
    }}
    width="100%"
  >
    <SpacingBestPractices />
  </Example>
  <Example
    height="none"
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Use spacing design tokens to style element-level components. Instead use component-specific tokens or element tokens which will ensure correct sizing of elements across screen sizes.`,
    }}
  >
    <SpacingBestPractices bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

Border sizing follows similar principles, using t-shirt sizes to control border thickness.

For example, if you were to implement the following code, you would have a Box with width of medium, height of small, and a border with a size of small.

```
<Box 
    border={{ color: 'border', size: 'small' }}
    width="medium"
    height="small" 
/>
```

<Box width="medium" margin={{bottom: 'large'}}>
  <Image
    src="/border-sizing.png"
    alt="Demonstration of t-shirt sizing for border on Box"
  />
</Box>

### Composability and scaling between t-shirt sizes

Sizes are intended to help give a UI a unified, harmonious experience. Therefore, there is a relationship between the pixel values that each size value maps to.

A given size (e.g., medium) is one half of the next size up (e.g., large).

```
small (192px) + small (192px) = medium (384px)
medium (384px) + medium (384px) = large (768px)
```

### Containers

Containers define the minimum or maximum width or height for content areas.

Container tokens are particularly useful when defining grid layouts. In other cases, consider the approach of [content-driven layouts](/templates/content-layouts#content-driven-layouts) to avoid artificially restricting content.

There are 11 container tokens to provide flexibility to cater to various design needs.

### Radius

Radius tokens define the rounding of corners on elements. Radius can be used as a tool to further emphasize the shape or relationship between certain elements.

Larger elements, like page sections, may have a larger radius while elements nested within may have smaller radii.

### Default `size` of "medium"

For components that support a `size` prop, the default size is `medium`. This means that if you do not specify your own `size`, the component will render with the styling that corresponds with "medium" size.

Notice in this example of Button sizes how the "Default" button is the same size as the "Medium" button. In the code, you'll see:

```
<Button label="Default" primary />
<Button size="medium" label="Medium" primary />
```

Because `medium` is the default size, you can simplify your code by implementing a component without the `size` prop when `medium` is the desired size.

<Example
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/button?theme=hpe#props"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/button/ButtonSizingExample.js"
  height={{ min: 'small' }}
>
  <ButtonSizingExample />
</Example>

## Responsiveness

Layouts should be designed with responsiveness in mind to meet a user wherever they are &mdash; whether on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.

The values of semantic spacing and radius design tokens step down in size at the `small` [breakpoint](/design-tokens/global#breakpoint). This retains appropriate proportions between shape, spacing, and content as the screen size decreases.

When utilizing the CSS files, a media query is included in the `dimension.small.css` file to adjust the token values at the `small` breakpoint.

To further refine layouts for different screen sizes, various [breakpoints](/design-tokens/global#breakpoint) can be used to instruct logic for layout adjustments.
