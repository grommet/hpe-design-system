T-shirt sizing leverages familiar clothing sizes of "small", "medium", "large", and other ranges of sizes to drive the sizing and spacing of layouts and components. Each t-shirt size ultimately resolves to a specific pixel or rem value.

Read about the [foundational scale](/design-tokens/layout-and-spacing#foundational-scale) for more information on how t-shirt sizes are generated.

T-shirt sizing controls various aspects of a user interface:

- [Layout and spacing](/design-tokens/layout-and-spacing)
- [Typography](/design-tokens/typography-system)
- [Element and component sizing](/design-tokens/element)

## Why t-shirt sizing?

T-shirt sizing provides the benefits of [semantic styling](/design-tokens/overview#semantic-tokens), make designing and developing more efficient.

In nearly every case, designs and development should use t-shirt sizes. If you find yourself specifying custom pixel values, this should be a warning signaling either:

- A need to consult with your designer about why a custom value is needed.
- Something in the implementation can and should be simplified.
- There could be a gap in the Design System which should be reported and addressed.

## Example

<Example code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/layouts/BoxExample.js">
  <BoxExample />
</Example>

## Default component size

The default component size is `medium`. In Grommet, this means that if you do not specify `size`, the component will render with the styling that corresponds with "medium" size.

Notice in this example of Button sizes how the "Default" button is the same size as the "Medium" button. In the code, you'll see:

```
<Button label="Default" primary />
<Button size="medium" label="Medium" primary />
```

Because `medium` is the default size, you can simplify your code by implementing a component without the `size` prop when `medium` is the desired size.

<Example
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/button?theme=hpe#props"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/components/button/ButtonSizingExample.js"
  height={{ min: 'small' }}
>
  <ButtonSizingExample />
</Example>

## Grommet-specific theme structure

In grommet-theme-hpe, t-shirt sizes are defined in the following structure:

```js
{
  global: {
    borderSize: {}, // supported border-width sizes
    edgeSize: {}, // supported pad, margin, gap sizes
    radius: {}, // suported border-radius sizes
    size: {}, // supported width, height sizes
    breakpoint: {
      xsmall: {
        borderSize: {}, // values for xsmall screens
        edgeSize: {}, // values  for xsmall screens
        radius: {}, // values for xsmall screens
        size: {}, // values for xsmall screens
      },
      small: {
        borderSize: {}, // values for small screens
        edgeSize: {}, // values  for small screens
        radius: {}, // values for small screens
        size: {}, // values for small screens
      }
    }
  },
}
```

For Grommet, use [Grommet documentation](https://v2.grommet.io/) to determine which t-shirt size props (width, height, pad, size, etc.) are supported on each component.
