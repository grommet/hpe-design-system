Spacing sizes are a subset of the [scale system](/foundation/scale-system),
supporting proximity principles to shape relationships between content and establish
hierarchy on a page. These principles are applied through
[spacing design tokens](/design-tokens/layout-and-spacing#spacing), which define the
padding within, margin around, and gap between content.

Effective spacing guides a user's eye through the interface, making it easier to
understand how elements relate to one another. The HPE Design System minimizes use of
borders to separate content. Instead spacing, typography, and background color are
combined to create visual hierarchy.

## Spacing scale

Use spacing to:

- Create separation between [content containers](/foundation/content-container-sizing) (gaps).
- Set space between a container's boundary and its content (padding).
- Define spacing within subsections of content (gap).

      Relying on margin can lead to unpredictable responsive and/or adaptive
      layouts and should be used with caution, if at all. Most layouts can be
      achieved using only gap and padding, resulting in more flexible,
      predictable, and maintainable designs.
