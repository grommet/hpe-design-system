Creating accessible applications means providing experiences that are easily usable by those who rely on keyboard navigation or screen readers, who are colorblind, or who are experiencing some other temporary, situational, or permanent disability.

The HPE Design System provides the design and developement tools to build accessible applications that are consistent across teams.

See our list of [resources](#resources) for tools that can help you do a baseline audit of the accessibility of your application.

## Accessibility in design

Usability testing and best practice research build the foundation for our design decisions. View the "Use Cases and Research" page within an HPE Design System Figma file for more detail on the decision making process for a given component.

The [HPE Design System Colors](/foundation/color) were selected to meet WCAG standards. Notably, text colors are accessible on [background colors](/foundation/color#background-colors) and call-to-action colors, like [HPE Green](/foundation/color#green-color-accessibility).

## Accessibility in development

We recommend you develop your apps using [Grommet](https://v2.grommet.io/) because it seamlessly integrates with [grommet-theme-hpe](https://github.com/grommet/grommet-theme-hpe) and is built to support keyboard navigation, HTML landmarks, and many ARIA attributes out of the box.

While supplemental attributes may need to be implemented and accessibility testing should still be performed, Grommet handles many of the general DOM requirements for you.

For guidance on setting up your development environment, see our [Developer Guidance](/extend/developer-guidance).

## Resources

These tools can help you take a baseline assessment of the accessibility of your application. While these tools are not exhaustive in identifying all accessibility criteria, they are a powerful start.

- [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/): A robust set of recommendations that guide how components should be built for the web.
- [WAVE (Web Accessibility Evalulation Tool) Browser Plugin](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/): Scans webpages to identify missing HTML requirements and color contrast standards.
- [WebAIM Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/): Check color contrast ratios of specific color values to indetify if they meet WCAG AA and/or AAA standards.
- [Colorblind Web Page Fitler](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/): See what your application looks like to users with various types of colorblindness.
