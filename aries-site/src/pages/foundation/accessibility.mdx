At HPE, we believe in being a force for good. We solve for humanity with humanity.
We use technology to make the world better. We are unconditionally inclusive.
**We believe that being accessible is a requirement, not an option**.

<blockquote>
  "The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone, regardless
  of disability, is an essential aspect."

## Built into all Design System tools

Creating accessible applications means providing experiences that are easily
usable by those who rely on keyboard navigation or screen readers, who are
colorblind, or who are experiencing some other temporary, situational, or
permanent disability.

Considerations for sight, mobility, hearing, and cognition are incorporated
into all HPE Design System components, patterns, and guidance, providing
design and development tools for all teams to build accessible applications.

Get started with these [resources and tools](#resources) to perform a
baseline audit of the accessibility of your application.

## Accessibility in design

Usability testing and best practice research build the foundation for all
design decisions. Each HPE Design System Figma file contains a "Use Cases
and Research" page detailing the considerations and decision making process
for a given component.

[Designer Guidance](/extend/designer-guidance#setting-up-your-figma-account) to sign up.

As example, the [HPE Design System Colors](/foundation/color) were selected to meet WCAG
standards. Notably, text colors are accessible on
[background colors](/foundation/color#background-colors) and call-to-action
colors, like [HPE Green](/foundation/color#green-color-accessibility).

## Accessibility in development

We recommend you develop your apps using [Grommet](https://v2.grommet.io/)
because it seamlessly integrates with [grommet-theme-hpe](https://github.com/grommet/grommet-theme-hpe)
and is built to support keyboard navigation, HTML landmarks, and many ARIA attributes
out of the box.

While supplemental attributes may need to be implemented and accessibility testing
should still be performed, Grommet handles many of the general DOM requirements for you.

For guidance on setting up your development environment, see [Developer Guidance](/extend/developer-guidance).

## Resources

These tools can help you take a baseline assessment of the accessibility of your application. While these tools are not exhaustive in identifying all accessibility criteria, they are a powerful start.
