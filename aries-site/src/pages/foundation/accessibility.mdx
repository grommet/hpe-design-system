At HPE, we believe in being a force for good. We solve for humanity with humanity.
We use technology to make the world better. We are unconditionally inclusive.
**We believe that being accessible is a requirement, not an option**.

  of disability, is an essential aspect."

## Built into all Design System tools

Creating accessible applications means providing experiences that are easily
usable by those who rely on keyboard navigation or screen readers, who are
colorblind, or who are experiencing some other temporary, situational, or
permanent disability.

Considerations for sight, mobility, hearing, and cognition are incorporated
into all HPE Design System components, patterns, and guidance, providing
design and development tools for all teams to build accessible applications.

Get started with these resources and subsections to learn more about accessibility
in practice and perform a baseline audit of the accessibility of your application:
