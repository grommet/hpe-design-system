At HPE, we believe in being a force for good. We solve for humanity with humanity.
We use technology to make the world better. We are unconditionally inclusive.
**We believe that being accessible is a requirement, not an option**.

<blockquote>
  "The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone, regardless
  of disability, is an essential aspect."
</blockquote>

> &mdash; Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web

## Built into all Design System tools

Creating accessible applications means providing experiences that are easily
usable by those who rely on keyboard navigation or screen readers, who are
colorblind, or who are experiencing some other temporary, situational, or
permanent disability.

Considerations for sight, mobility, hearing, and cognition are incorporated
into all HPE Design System components, patterns, and guidance, providing
design and development tools for all teams to build accessible applications.

Get started with these [resources and tools](#resources) to perform a
baseline audit of the accessibility of your application.

## Designer and Software Developer Guides

The following accessibility guides are HPE internal links that offer relevant information to help designers and developers create accessibile products that meet the requirements of HPE’s clients.

## Accessibility in Design

Usability testing and best practice research build the foundation for all
design decisions. Each HPE Design System Figma file contains a "Use Cases
and Research" page detailing the considerations and decision making process
for a given component.

Not part of the Design System Figma? See our
[Designer Guidance](/foundation/designer-guidance#setting-up-your-figma-account) to sign up.

As an example, the [HPE Design System Colors](/foundation/color) were selected to meet WCAG
standards. Notably, text colors are accessible on
[background colors](/foundation/color#background-colors) and call-to-action
colors, like [HPE Green](/foundation/color#green-color-accessibility).

## Accessibility in Development

We recommend you develop your apps using [Grommet](https://v2.grommet.io/)
because it seamlessly integrates with [grommet-theme-hpe](https://github.com/grommet/grommet-theme-hpe)
and is built to support keyboard navigation, HTML landmarks, and many ARIA attributes
out of the box.

While supplemental attributes may need to be implemented and accessibility testing
should still be performed, Grommet handles many of the general DOM requirements for you.

For guidance on setting up your development environment, see [Developer Guidance](/foundation/developer-guidance).

## Government Standards and Regulations

To help enforce the World Wide Web's accessibility, policies and laws have been put in place which require certain standards to be met for all web, software and non-web documents. 

As a designer or developer, we are morally responsible for creating accessible products, and it is necessary that we are aware of the mandated standards established across the world. The following links provide insight into how governments and policy makers have come to include accessibility into laws, emphasizing the importance of making the web inclusive for all. In general, it is helpful to understand some of these policies and how they may affect your work product.

- [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/): A robust set of international accessibility design guidelines. The guidelines identified as level A and AA are the required design elements for all applications and are incorporated in the US Section 508 standard and HPE's Design System.
- [U.S. Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/): This site provides guidance for IT accessibility, covering program management, procurement, tools, training, and policy compliance. 
- [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/ada_intro.htm): An equal opportunity law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities where public services are offered — now including the public web domain.
- [European Accessibility Act (EAA)](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1202): A directive that aims to improve the market for accessible products and services that have been identified as most important for individuals with disabilities.
