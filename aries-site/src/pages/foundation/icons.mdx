Icons can be used to represent information to users, such as actions a user can perform or different types of functionality.

It is important that the use of an icon is clear. In some cases, it may be beneficial to pair icons with text to ensure the use of the icon is properly understood, but if text is always needed, consider using the text without an icon.
Best practice is to not use icons unless most users are already familiar with their meaning. Otherwise, multiple products may end up using the same obscure icon for different reasons, resulting in confusion for users using those products.

  <Button
    icon={<Figma color="plain" />}
    label="Open in Figma"
    target="_blank"

    href="https://www.figma.com/design/Hio1n5z95fdxSxuS86dLqJ/HPE-Icons---V2?node-id=66-13&t=S5gUdNzCkbPmEoZF-1"

### Developing with Grommet Icons

For instructions on how to install and use Grommet icons within your
application, check out the Grommet Icons site.

<Button
  alignSelf="start"
  label="HPE Theme Grommet Icons"
  href="https://icons.grommet.io/?theme=hpe"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noreferrer noopener"
  secondary
/>

### Accessibility

For screen reader accessibility there is an aria-label provided for
each icon. The color of the icons should also pass any color
contrast ratio.

### Icon within components

Icons can be used in a variety of different ways. They are used within other components such as [Search](/components/search), [Menu](/components/menu), [Button](/components/button).

<Example
  docs="https://icons.grommet.io/?theme=hpe"
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/icons/IconComponentExample.js"
  figma="https://www.figma.com/design/Hio1n5z95fdxSxuS86dLqJ/HPE-Icons---V2?node-id=66-13&t=S5gUdNzCkbPmEoZF-1"
>
  <IconComponentExample />
</Example>

### Icon sizes

The default icon size is medium. This should be adjusted depending
on where in your application the icon is being used.

<Example code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/icons/IconSizeExample.js">
  <IconSizeExample />
</Example>

### Button icons

The icon should be centered aligned with any text that is being used next to it. The correct size icon should be paired with similar size text. When using the Icon as a button both the label and icon will be wrapped within that Button.

<Example code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/icons/IconSizeExample.js">
  <IconTextExample />
</Example>

### Icon plain color

The default icon color is 'text-strong' for the corresponding light/dark mode. For some icons there are spcific colors in how they are represented, such as HPE, HP that need to respect the built in colors for those SVGs so the color prop can be given 'plain'.

<Example code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/icons/IconPlainExample.js">
  <IconPlainExample />
</Example>

### Icon height

In instances where icons are presented alongside text in a row with `align="start"`, it is necessary to add a `height` property to the icon. The value of the height property should match the t-shirt size of the accompanying text. For example, an icon should receive `height="medium"` when presented alongside `medium` (default) text.

The `height` property on icon is only necessary when a row uses `align="start"`.

HPE theme icons are sized to match font-sizes, as opposed to line-heights, in order for a more balanced presentation of icons and text. Applying the `height` property to an icon ensures the necessary top and bottom padding is applied to the icon to align with the line-height of the text.

<Example code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/icons/IconHeightExample.js">
  <IconHeightExample />
</Example>

## Core icons

<IconResourceActionsExample />

### UI actions

<IconUIActionsExample />

### UI controls
