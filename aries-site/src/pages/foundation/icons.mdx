Icons can appear as stand-alone decorative elements or be embedded within components such as buttons and tabs to enhance usability and recognition. They provide quick visual cues that help users interpret actions and content at a glance.

Icons should support recognition, not create ambiguity. Familiar, universal symbols (e.g., search, delete, close) can stand alone, while less common icons should be paired with a label to ensure clarity. Thoughtful, consistent use prevents overuse or misuse, avoiding the confusion caused by unclear or inconsistent symbolism.

Icons in the HPE icon library are semantically named to indicate each icon’s intended usage. Every icon includes metadata to improve discovery and provide additional context about its purpose.


- Use icons only when their meaning is clear and purposeful.
- Pair unfamiliar icons with a text label to aid comprehension.
- If an icon always needs a label to be understood, consider using text alone.
- Avoid re-using the same symbol for different meanings across products.
- Keep icons visually consistent with the library’s size, and color standards.
- Use decorative icons sparingly — they should enhance, not distract.

### Developing with HPE Icons

For guidance on installing and migrating to use the @hpe-design/icons-grommet icons in your application, refer to the migration documentation.

### Icon sizes

The default icon size is medium. Icons can be scaled using predefined size options to align with our typography scale, ensuring consistent vertical rhythm and proper inline alignment with text.

<Example code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/icons/IconSizeExample.js">
  <IconSizeExample />
</Example>

### Icon color

Standalone icon components use the default color token **icon-default**.\
Decorative icons may also use **icon-strong**, **icon-weak**, **icon-disabled**, or **icon-primary** to convey emphasis or state.

Non-semantic icons, such as brand or third-party SVGs, should display their native colors. To preserve their original styling, apply the prop `color="plain"`.

<Example code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/icons/IconPlainExample.js">
  <IconPlainExample />
</Example>

### Status icons

Status icons are reserved for drawing attention to information about system health. They must be paired with the appropriate status color as defined by brand.

<Example code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/icons/IconStatusExample.js">
  <IconStatusExample />
</Example>

### Aligning with text

When icons are displayed inline with text in a row using align="start", apply a height property to the icon.
Set the height value to match the T-shirt size of the accompanying text — for example, use height="medium" when placed beside medium (default) text.

The height property is only required when the parent row uses align="start".

In the HPE theme, icons are sized relative to font size rather than line height. This provides a more balanced visual relationship between icons and text. Applying a height value ensures the icon receives the correct top and bottom padding to align visually with the text’s line height.

<Example code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/icons/IconHeightExample.js">
  <IconHeightExample />
</Example>

### Accessibility

Each icon includes an aria-label to support screen readers.\
Use the **a11yTitle** prop to override or customize the default label when needed.\
Ensure icon colors maintain sufficient contrast against their background in accordance with WCAG guidelines.

### Icons within components

Icons are available for use inside other components such as [Search fields](/components/search), [Menus](https://design-system.hpe.design/components/menu?#with-custom-icon) and [Buttons](https://design-system.hpe.design/components/button?#button-with-icon). When placed within a component, an icon will inherit styling, color, and scale properties from its parent component to maintain theme alignment.
