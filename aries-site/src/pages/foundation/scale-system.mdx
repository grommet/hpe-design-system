The scale defines how UI elements proportionally relate to one another, ensuring composability
and harmony among layout elements. The system defines a base unit and scale ratio from which
all steps of the scale are derived. Subsets of the scale are used to define spacing sizes and
content container sizes.

Additionally, the scale system allows the HPE Design System to provide turnkey solutions
which automatically scale UIs dependent on viewport widths, devices, and user preferences.

## Principles

The following scale system has been built from the following principles:

- **Proportional:** Use a natural ratio where each step in the scale is proportional all other steps.
- **Composable:** Each scale step may is divisible into halves, thirds, quarters, etc. Inversely,
  each step is composable from smaller steps.
- **Flexible:** Scale may be divided into subsets, providing choices serving a variety of use cases.

## Foundational scale

The sizing scale consists of a primary scale based on the doubling/halving of a 24px base unit and
a supplementary scale doubling/halving a 16px base unit.

The resulting scale steps: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 192, 256, 384, 512,
768, 1024, 1536.

[Spacing](/add-link-here), [container](/add-link-here), [radius](/add-link-here), and
[borderWidth](/add-link-here) design tokens are defined using subsets of this scale.

## Composability

Each scale step may is divisible into halves, thirds, quarters, etc. Alternatively each step is
composable from smaller steps. This means that spacing or container [t-shirt sizes](/foundation/tshirt-sizing) 
added together or subtracted from one another will be equal to another t-shirt size on the scale.
