The scale establishes how UI elements proportionally relate to one another, ensuring 
composability and harmony within the layout. It defines a base unit and scale ratio from 
which all steps of the scale are derived. Subsets of the scale are used to define spacing 
sizes and content container sizes.

Additionally, the scale system provides ready-to-use functionality that automatically 
adapts UIs based on viewport width, device type, and user preferences.

## Principles

The scale system has been built from the following principles:

- **Proportional:** Each step in the scale follows a consistent ratio, ensuring all
  steps are proportional to one another.
- **Composable:** Each step in the scale is divisible into halves, thirds, quarters, and so on.
  Conversely, each step may be assembled from smaller increments.
- **Flexible:** Subsets of the scale accommodate a wide range of use cases, from small spacing needs
  to large containers and layouts.
- **Harmonious:** The scale promotes visual harmony and balance across UI elements by ensuring
  consistent sizing relationships.

## Foundational scale

The scale system is built upon two interconnected scales:
- **Primary scale**: Based on a 24px base unit, where each step is achieved by doubling or halving the previous value.
- **Supplementary scale**: Based on a 16px base unit, following the same doubling and halving principle.

The resulting scale steps: <br />
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 192, 256, 384, 512, 768, 1024, 1536.

Design tokens for [spacing](/add-link-here), [containers](/add-link-here), 
[border radius](/add-link-here), and [border width](/add-link-here) are defined as subsets of 
this foundational scale.

## Composability

Each step in the scale is divisible into halves, thirds, or quarters. Conversely, each step can be 
composed by combining smaller steps. This ensures that when you add or subtract spacing or 
container [t-shirt sizes](/foundation/tshirt-sizing), the result is always another valid size on 
the scale.
