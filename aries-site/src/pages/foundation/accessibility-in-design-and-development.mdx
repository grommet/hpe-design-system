## Accessibility in Design

Usability testing and best practice research build the foundation for all
design decisions. Each HPE Design System Figma file contains a "Use Cases
and Research" page detailing the considerations and decision making process
for a given component.

Not part of the Design System Figma? See our
[Designer Guidance](/foundation/designer-guidance#setting-up-your-figma-account) to sign up.

As an example, the [HPE Design System Colors](/foundation/color) were selected to meet WCAG
standards. Notably, text colors are accessible on [background colors](/foundation/color#background-colors) and call-to-action
colors, like [HPE Green](/foundation/color#green-color-accessibility).

## Accessibility in Development

We recommend you develop your apps using [Grommet](https://v2.grommet.io/)
because it seamlessly integrates with [grommet-theme-hpe](https://github.com/grommet/grommet-theme-hpe)and is built to support keyboard navigation, HTML landmarks, and many ARIA attributes out of the box.

While supplemental attributes may need to be implemented and accessibility testing should still be performed, Grommet handles many of the general DOM requirements for you.

For guidance on setting up your development environment, see [Developer Guidance](/foundation/developer-guidance).
