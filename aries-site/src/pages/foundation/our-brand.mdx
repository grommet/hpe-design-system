Our logos are a powerful expression of our brand and who we are. The
distinctive symbol, we call the "Element," speaks to our focus on
customers and their success, with a color which signals growth and
opportunity, and an approachable word-mark which says we are welcoming
to our partners.

All usage of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise brand elements is
subject to the requirements and restrictions
outlined in the [Terms of Use](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/about/legal/terms-of-use.html).
For additional guidance and logo usage refer

## Hewlett Packard Enterprise

Hewlett Packard Enterprise, also known as HPE has a couple logo
variations to help build your experience. Each variation should be
used in the appropriate context. Being aware of different uses helps
make your experience more compliant.

### HPE logo

Use the HPE Logo when establishing the brand and building layouts with
less dense content. Place the logo on the top left or bottom left
depending on the layout; neither placement is necessarily preferred.

<UsageExample label="hpe-logo" themeMode="light">
  <Box width="small">
    <Image alt="HPE logo" fit="contain" src="/HPE_logo_full-clr_pos_rgb.svg" />
  </Box>
</UsageExample>

<UsageExample label="hpe-logo-invert" themeMode="dark">
  <Box width="small">
    <Image alt="HPE logo" fit="contain" src="/HPE_logo_full-clr_rev_rgb.svg" />
  </Box>
</UsageExample>

### HPE Element

Always use the HPE Element at the top-left of your service or product
experience. To ensure consistency across HPE, the Element should
always be accompanied by the company name and product/service name. Do
not veer from the layout and spacing of the elements.

<UsageExample
  label="hpe-element"
  themeMode="light"
  pad={{
    horizontal: 'xlarge',
    vertical: 'medium',
    small: { horizontal: '3xlarge', vertical: 'xlarge' },
  }}
>
  <HpeElementExample />
</UsageExample>
<UsageExample
  label="hpe-element-invert"
  themeMode="dark"
  pad={{
    horizontal: 'xlarge',
    vertical: 'medium',
    small: { horizontal: '3xlarge', vertical: 'xlarge' },
  }}
