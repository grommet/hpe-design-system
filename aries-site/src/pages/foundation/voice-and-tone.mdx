## Messaging Voice, Tone, and Content

Depending on where you look, you will find different definitions for tone and voice.  By reading through many of these different definitions, a picture emerges:

| **Voice**		                  | **Tone**                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Who they hear		              | What they hear                              |
| Personality		                | Attitude                                    |
| How you are doing the writing	| Who they hear                               |
| Style		                      | How your message comes across               |
| What makes us uniquely us		  | How we communicate to our specific audience |

### Voice

Voice is all about who the reader hears talking in our messaging; it has to do with the worldview of the author. Voice can be spoken, witty, friendly, formal, etc. We can be perceived as being intelligent, experienced, mature, accepting, objective, etc.

A person's voice typically does not change once established. If our voice (HPE's voice) is inconsistent, people will notice. For example, people notice the difference between writing academically when compared to sounding like a 5-year old. This kind of inconsistency can result in lack of trust.

### Tone

Tone has to do with what is conveyed or how it comes across. It can express seriousness, urgency, playfulness, objectivity, intimacy, condescension, etc.

Unlike voice, tone can change based on the target audience and the subject matter. It is situational. For example, tone is very different when giving directions during an emergency vs ordering a pizza.

### Point of View

Point of view has to do with the perspective from which the message is written. First person perspective uses words like: I, me, us, we, our, etc. Second person uses any form of the word "you" which has the effect of addressing the reader. Third person directs the reader to things that are neither the writer or the reader.

Examples:

- *We noticed the server is malfunctioning.* (1st person-ish)
- *Your server is malfunctioning.* (2nd person-ish)
- *The server is malfunctioning.* (3rd person - no focus on the writer or the reader)

### Our Voice and Tone

We want our messaging to be informative, concise, and trustworthy. We should be perceived as intelligent, experienced, inclusive and non-threatening. Our messaging should be active, positive, objective, conversational American English written in a third person point of view.

The following are some high-level guidelines for constructing good messaging:

- Conversational American English
- Correct grammar and punctuation
- Active tense
- Positive, not negative
- Not robotic sounding
- Never condescending
- Establish context
- Lead with what is most important
- Inspire trust and confidence
- Explain using terminology consistent with the UI
- Avoid charged words like "*error*"
- Avoid blame casting (on user or on software)
- State facts without coloring them in opinions
- Avoid personal pronouns
- Careful with words like "*Please*"
- Do not use "*contact your administrator*" (the admin is likely the user) or "*contact HPE*" (HPE might not be the support contact -- it might be a channel partner)
- Read your message out loud to another person. Is this how you would say it out loud? Does the other person feel this is how two people would converse?

## Capitalization

The general rule is that things that are sentences should follow sentence capitalization rules. And, things that are titles/headings/labels should follow title capitalization rules.

Sentences follow sentence capitalization rules:

- Paragraphs of text
- Tooltips
- Notifications
- Help

Titles follow title capitalization rules:

- Page/dialog titles
- Section headings
- Attribute labels
- Table column headings
- Legends
- Tabs/Buttons

Capitalize proper nouns. HPE brand and product names are proper nouns.

Fight the urge to elevate normal nouns to proper noun status. For example, if you are in a "data sources" page and need to say something about data sources, do not capitalize it. Unless it is a true proper noun, leave it uncapitalized when following sentence capitalization rules.

DO NOT USE ALL CAPS IN EITHER TITLES OR SENTENCES. It is harder to read and is equated with yelling.

## Acronyms

Do not use an uncommon acronym in messaging without first defining the acronym the first time it is used. Do not use an acronym like this unless it is going to be used multiple times in the message.

- Incorrect: *The UBC is meeting tomorrow.*
- Incorrect: *The UBC (university building council) is meeting tomorrow.*
- Correct: *The UBC (university building council) is meeting tomorrow. If you have UBC-related business, send it to the UBC administrator for addition to the meeting agenda.*
	
## Branding

To aid in comprehension, do not use full brand/product names in messaging. Refer to these with shortened names. For example, "*HPE GreenLake LightHouse*" is a mouthful and if needed several times in a sentence, set context and consider using a simpler "*Lighthouse*" the second, third, Nth time.

A best practice for developers is to use parameter substitution in messaging where branded names occur.

- Branding can change over time. E.g. GreenLake Central has recently been rebranded to Cloud Services. Implementing messages with `${prodname}` instead of hardcoded messages would make this an easy fix.
- Use of parameter substitution ensures that brand names are spelled and capitalized consistently in all messages.
- Consider formal and informal substitution values that can be used in different contexts. For example:

> formal = HPE Ezmeral Container Platform
>
> normal = Ezmeral Container Platform
> 
> short = Container Platform

## Language DOs and DON'Ts

**Do this:**

 - Use words like "a", "an", "the" so we don't sound like a robot.
 - Add punctuation to the end of each sentence.
 - Use correct punctuation within a sentence.
 - Feel free to use contractions.
 - Adjectives typically come before nouns. 
   - Incorrect: *the operation specified is…*
   - Correct: *the specified operation is…*
 - Adjectives in English appear in a specific order. If this order is violated, the sentence will seem odd.
   - From the book *The Elements of Eloquence*: ...adjectives in English absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-shape-color-origin-material-purpose Noun. So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess with that word order in the slightest you’ll sound like a maniac. It’s an odd thing that every English speaker uses that list, but almost none of us could write it out.
   - There's a slightly different order listed in the Cambridge Dictionary.
   - Therefore: *two failing SATA SSD drives* and not *SSD SATA failing two drives*

**Don't do this:**

 - Avoid possessives (e.g. *the server hardware's power is off*).
 - Eliminate run-on sentences.
 - Don't overuse the word "please".  While "please" is allowed, starting every action phrase with the word "please" is not appropriate.  In general, we should be limiting the use of "please".
 - When the subject of a sentence is a specific resource, do not use that resource’s name as an adjective describing a resource type.  Instead, use the type as an adjective describing the resource:
  - Incorrect: *the ABC uplink set has…*
  - Correct: *the uplink set "ABC" has…*
 - It is not necessary to tell the user to *retry the operation* in most cases.  For example, if the user has entered incorrect or illegal values, we only need to tell them to specify correct values and do not also need to tell them to retry the operation.  The retry is intuitive and obvious in these cases.
 - Never tell the user to retry after *some time*.  Be more specific.  E.g. *after 3 minutes* or *after the refresh has completed"*
 - Don't tell the user to *try* or *attempt* things. It does not convey confidence. Instead, tell them to do things.
  - Incorrect: *Try resetting the interconnect.*
  - Correct: *Reset the interconnect.*
 - Don't say *bad request*. This is blaming the user.  Just explain what is wrong.
 - Do not use internal terminology in external messaging.
 - Do not refer to "the" or "your" administrator in messaging.  More often than not, the user reading the message is the administrator. Be more specific.
 - When making parenthetical comments…
  - Don’t add spaces inside the parentheses: *this is bad ( yes it is ).*
  - Do add spaces outside the parentheses: *this is bad(yes it is).* The exception would be things like “server(s)”.
 - Avoid incorrect use of the word "input".
  - Incorrect: *Specify a valid certificate as input.*
  - Correct: *Specify a valid certificate.*
  - Incorrect: *One of the input parameters is null.*
  - Correct: *One of the parameters is null.* or *One of the specified parameters is null.* or *The "name" parameter is null.*

## Case Study

Here is an example of messaging related to a condition where a Kubernetes cluster is running low on available memory and different ways of handling it.

**Image goes here**

Problems:
- No punctuation
- No verb
- No context (what cluster?)
- Robotic (robots don't use words like "a", "the", "is")
- Incorrect capitalization of memory (it is not a proper noun)

**Image goes here**

Problems:
- It is better to have the resource type (cluster) precede the resource name (ABC).
- Names are user-specified and can cause readability issues if not quoted or hyperlinks. See what happens if "ABC" is replaced with names like "the", "storage", "Joe's", "obsolete", or any random string containing spaces.
- What does "out of memory" actually mean? We should be more specific.

**Image goes here**

Problems:
- Strongly consider hyperlinking any named resource so that a user can directly navigate to it from a notification.
- 95% of 10TB means that 500GB are still free. But, 95% of 16GB means only 800MB remain. Showing only percentages doesn't offer the user enough context to make a decision.

**Image goes here**

Problems:
- What is the user supposed to do about this? Never raise an issue without offering a solution.

**Image goes here**

Problems:
- What is the needful? This is a saying not used in conversational American English and does not give the user specific guidance.

**Image goes here**

Problems:
- The user purchased the cluster to use it. Telling them to stop using it is not going to go over well.
- Is this really a critical issue? Unused resources are often considered wasted resources. It is actually a good thing to be fully utilizing your hardware.
- In an aaS world, additional capacity should be a simple add-on to an existing service. As such, this may not be a critical issue, but could be transformed to a lower priority marketing message.

Problems:
- If possible, give the user a way to directly perform a mentioned action.

## Miscellany

### Quoting

In messaging that contains user-specified content, use double-quotes around this content if it is not rendered as a hyperlink. If user-content is rendered as a hyperlink, the hyperlink styling is sufficient to offset the content from other text in the message.

Why is this important? User-entered names can contain spaces, and if they are not quoted or rendered as hyperlinks, they can hinder comprehension of a message.  

Here is a correct example: *the uplink set "{0}" has a problem*. Compare this to an incorrect example: *the uplink set {0} has a problem*. If the uplink set is named "deleted", this will read as *the uplink set deleted has a problem*.

### Referring to support

- Do not tell the user to contact their administrator. The user is likely the administrator.
- Do not tell the user to contact HPE. A 3rd party may be providing support to the customer.
- Use something like: *Contact your authorized support representative.*
- Do not overuse this phrase. If the resolution to a problem is clear, just give the resolution and do not add that the user should contact support.
- Contacting support costs everypone time and money, so do not turn every issue into a potential support issue. It makes our product seem unnecessarily fragile and can result in unnecessary support calls.
- Do use this phrase for internal errors where there's nothing else the user can do (i.e. when it is the only resolution).

### Localization

A best practice for developers is to add comments to messages in the properties files or message catalogs. Reviewers and translators (and ultimately, customers) will thank you.

- Document all parameter substitution values. When the value is a resource, be specific. Is it a name? Is it a URI? Is it raw JSON that needs to be encapsulated in curly braces? Or is it pre-formatted JSON that includes curly braces?
- For errors and alerts, document the severity associated with the message.
- Document the type of message (alert, task, etc).
- If the message doesn't document (for the user) full details of how this problem occurs or what to do about it, add the details in comments.
- Some context around the task being performed or the resource category involved is useful.
- Is the message an API-only message (does not appear in the UI)? If yes, document it as such.

### Scale

Consider singular and plural use cases and craft messages for each.

If a sentence contains a list, do not allow the length of the list to be unbounded. Instead, consider a construct like this: *The following policies have not been implemented: Policy A, Policy B, Policy C, and 5 others.*

### User Input

Unless there is a compelling reason, do not limit the character set that a user can use to name things. Names commonly contain non-alphanumeric characters and we must handle them correctly on input and in re-display via messaging. For example:

- *Joe’s system* (apostrophe for a possessive)
- *O’Reilly Auto Parts* (apostrophe in name)
- *Yahoo! Client* (company name includes a symbol)
- *Frank James-Martin* (Hyphen in name)
- *DC-NY-East* (Dashes in internal company identifiers)
- *Björk Guðmundsdóttir* (Unicode characters)
- *联想* (Unicode characters)
- *John Q. Public* (punctuation for abbreviation)
- *“”>* (An actual company name in the UK that the UK Companies House had to ban because it broke their systems. See [article](https://idle.slashdot.org/story/20/11/08/2334254/uk-agency-demands-company-stop-using-name-which-includes-an-html-closing-tag).)

Proper encoding/decoding of user-entered input must be performed to prevent SQL/XSS attacks. Input such as the following user input must not cause problems when the user-generated input is later incorporated in application messaging:
- *Robert’); DROP TABLE Students;--* (see: [https://xkcd.com/327/](https://xkcd.com/327/))

User-generated input can be arbitrarily long. When confronted with displaying user-generated input, plan for the 80% case, but define which of truncation (with hover) or wrapping will be used.

## Other Common Problems and How To Address Them
 
The following are commonly misspelled/mis-capitalized terms:

- The following must be spelled/capitalized as shown:
  - Kubernetes
  - Ethernet
  - Fibre Channel
  - FCoE
  - SNMP, SNMPv3
  - ID (not id or Id)
  - OK (not ok, Ok, or okay)
  - I/O (not IO or i/o)
  - API (not xApi) (either that, or be explicit and say X-API-Version)
- "Log in" is a verb (e.g. "Log in to the server").
- "Login" is a noun or adjective (e.g. "The login token has expired").
- Use the word "and" instead of an ampersand "&".
- Filesystem is one word.
- Use "host name" when referring to the name of a host.
- Use "hostname" when referring to the Unix command.

The following table contains a set of common mistakes found in messaging, along with suggested corrections:

| Don't	| Do |Notes |
| ----- | -- | ---- |
| internal error | unexpected problem | |	 
| coding error | unexpected problem | |
| issue/error | problem | |
| Failed to | Unable to | |
| X failed | Unable to X | |
| since | because | Unless referring to time |
| there's | there is | |
| non something | non-something | |
| can not | cannot | |
| associated to | associated with | |
| as the | because the | Only when it can be substituted with "because the".  There are valid uses of "as the", e.g. X must be the same as the Y. In general, don't use "as" where you can use "because". |
| as it has | because it has | In general, do not use "as" where you can use "because" |
| make sure | ensure | |
| check if | ensure that | Note: "check if" or "verify that" are never valid resolutions because they don't tell you what to do or how to do it. A resolution must be actionable. For example: "Check if the required CA certificates have been added and are valid" is not a good resolution. It does not tell you what to do if the certs have not been added or is the certs have been added but are not valid. Our messaging must lead the user to success -- not leave them guessing. |
| provide / provided, supply / supplied, give / given | specify / specified | Be careful with blind replacements here. In many cases, it is possible, but our "contact support" message includes the word "provide" and must not be changed to say "...specify a support dump." |
| try again / retry operation (when used as the sole recommended action) | Tell the user what they need to change and then tell them to try again. | At minimum, each instance needs to be evaluated more deeply to see what our code could do to prevent the user from doing something we could do ourselves.  If a retry is due to a timeout (proxy, etc), then first see if the code can be changed to use an exponential backoff algorithm to do its own retries.  Any time that retry will be used in messaging, the message itself needs more explanation for what actually went wrong. |
| try again / retry operation (without understanding the larger context) | Understand the context and give the correct recommendation. | E.g. in a sub-task of *add enclosure*, a try again resolution of any kind is inappropriate because the add enclosure will always result in an enclosure resource being created. The user cannot try the enclosure add a second time. |
| should | must | *Should* does not mean *must*. If you say that a value should be 0, that is only a suggestion. If it is a requirement, use the word "must". |
| has to be | must be | |
| were / was / had | are / is / has | Use "were"/"was"/"had" to refer to the past and "are"/"is"/"has" to refer to the present.  Notifications must typically refer to the present. Wrong: *there were no licenses*.  Right: *there are no licenses*.	Acceptable: *Multiple occurrences of the same network were found…* |
| mark | set / specify | Wrong: *There is more than one setting marked as Required*. Better: *More than one setting is specified as required.* |
| you / your | TBD | We strive to not use personal pronouns in error messaging. It is too easy to blame the user by using personal pronouns. In general, if the sentence can easily be changed to eliminate the use of these pronouns, do so. |
| as per the | per the | |
| hit / hitting | press / pressing | Users do not hit the keyboard. They press keys. |
| power down / turn off | power off | Also consider whether a shutdown is required. |
| ongoing | in progress | When referring to tasks, "ongoing" has the wrong connotation: long running perpetual tasks. This is OK: *ongoing server management*. Otherwise, use statements like: *the software upgrade is in progress* |
| recreate | re-create | "Recreate" means to enjoy a leisurely activity. Re-create means to create again. Try to avoid using recreate/re-create, in general, and see if there is a way to rephrase the message without this term. |
| getting | retrieving | |
| updation | update | "updation" is not a word. |
| is belonging | belongs | Bad example: *Server profile assigned to the hypervisor profile is belonging to enclosure group…* |
| is having | has | Bad example: *Server profile assigned to the host is having a different server hardware type…* |
| is not having | does not have | Bad example: *Hypervisor host XYZ is not having a server profile attached to it and so it is unsupported.* |
| is matching | matches | |
| is not matching with | does not match | |
| there are not enough | there are insufficient | In general, try to avoid this entirely. It is odd to start with "there are" only to end with the fact that this isn't true. For example, instead of telling the user that there are insufficient licenses to perform an action, you might tell them that all licenses are in use and the action cannot be performed. |
| simply | | Don't use this word. Never presume something is simple for the user. |
| drop down | menu / selection list | Refer to either a menu (e.g. action menu) or a selection list. |
| screen | page / dialog | A page is commonly a linkable, top-level visualization page shown in a browser. A dialog is a pop-up (sidebar, central, full-page) that overlays a page and typically results from the user performing an action. |
| verify if / check if | | Don't do it. Example: *Please verify if the input is bad*. Are we asking them to ensure it is bad or are we asking them to ensure it is good? |
| invalid | not valid | Machine translation can incorrectly translate "invalid", so it is better to use "not valid". However, it is even better to use neither and instead be specific about what the problem is. For example, if an input is not valid because it is too long, then tell the user the input is too long instead of telling them it is not valid. See: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/i/invalid-not-valid |
| and if | Split into two sentences | Bad example: *Retry the operation and if the problem persists, contact your authorized support representative and provide a support dump*. Good example: *Retry the operation. If the problem persists, contact your authorized support representative and provide a support dump*. In general, each separate option in an error resolution should be either, its own sentence, or in a comma separated list. The last-resort action of contacting support must always be in its own sentence. |

## American English

Our messaging standard is conversational American English. There are differences between English use and spelling in America vs in India or by the British.

### British English

Use American spelling, where there is a difference between American and British spelling. 

Many British words are spelled ending in "our" such as "colour". Use the American "or" variant instead: color.

Many British words are spelled ending in "yse" (analyse) or "ise" (realise). Use the American "yze"/"ize" variants instead: analyze/realize.

Other common differences to be aware of:
| British | American |
| ---- | ---- |
| Licence | License |
| Cancelled | Canceled |
| Centre | Center |
| Catalogue | Catalog |
| Behaviour | Behavior |
| Favourite | Favorite |
| Grey | Gray |
| Chips | Fries :smile: |
| Biscuit | Cookie :smile: |

When utilizing a spelling/grammar checker, set your locale to give American English suggestions.

### Indian English

This is a collection of common words or phrases used in India, that are not used in American English:

| If you find yourself using this… | Example | Use this instead | Why? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sorted | *The feature is not sorted.* | Use either "elaborated", "thought through", "analyzed", "planned". | Confusing. "Sorted" implies sorting in the computer sense. |
| Thus / Hence | *…, thus you must factory reset.* | Use "therefore". | Uncommon or too formal. |
| Do the needful | *The server is down. Do the needful.* | This is similar to "do what is necessary" or "do whatever it takes", but neither should be used in our messaging. Instead, be specific about what the user should do. | Never used. We should always be specific. |
| We will revert back | I send an email saying "do it like this" and you reply, *Thanks, we will revert back.* | *We will get back to you.&* | "Revert back" implies going back to a previous revision. |
| Strong all the more | *makes the case strong all the more.* | *makes the case stronger.* | Never used. |
| I have a doubt | *I have a doubt about that.* | *I have a question* | "I have a doubt about that" implies you think it is incorrect. |
