## Getting started

We're excited you're using the HPE Design System! Below are a set of resources that will help you get started using the HPE Design System components in your designs. If you don't find what you're looking for, please reach out in the #hpe-design-system channel on [Slack](https://grommet.slack.com).

### Setting up your Figma account

If you are new to Figma, the [Figma Getting Started](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002051613-Getting-Started) page is a good place to start.

[Create a Figma account](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039811114-Create-a-Figma-account) with your HPE email address. Using your HPE email provides immediate access to all HPE Design System files.

If you would prefer to access the HPE Design System library in a desktop app, you can download the [Figma Desktop App](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039823654-Download-the-Figma-Desktop-App#Download_the_Desktop_App) for MacOS or Windows.

### Joining the HPE Design System Figma team

1. Log into Figma and look for an HPE icon in your left control bar.
