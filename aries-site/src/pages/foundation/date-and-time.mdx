Date and time can appear in a wide variety of contexts:

- Data tables
- Inline with paragraph text
- Name value lists
- Notifications
- Log files

Depending on the context, date and time may be presented as:

| Format                          | Purpose                                                                         | Examples                      | Notes                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Absolute time](#absolute-time) | To provide the precise date and/or time of an event.                            | September 15, 2023; 3/27/2023 | The granularity and formatting depends on the context. See absolute time guidance. |
| [Relative time](#relative-time) | To display how long ago something occurred or in how long something will occur. | in 5 days, 3 days ago         | --                                                                                 |

Timestamps should always be stored in UTC, the universal standard. These UTC timestamps will then get converted to local time, if necessary, by the UI for display.

## Absolute time

Absolute time stamps display the precise date and time an action has occurred or will occur.

May be presented as:

- Date
- Date and time
  - Including seconds (and fractional seconds)
  - Including timezone

In most cases, absolute time should be presented according to the user's [locale](#locale-formatting) and [timezone](#timezones), indicating the timezone in the output.

Absolute time can be presented in a variety of formats:

export const date = new Date('2023-08-12');

Other than log files, date and time should be presented according to the [user's locale](#locale-formatting) and [timezone](#timezones).

For log files, there are two options:

1. Always output timestamps in UTC, indicating UTC in the output.
1. Allow the user to specify a default timezone and always output timestamps in that timezone, specifying the timezone in the output.

### Locale formatting

Date and time are formatted differently depending on the language and region. Some aspects that are locale-dependent include date and time ordering, separators, and 12-hour vs 24-hour clocks.

There are various [Javascript Date methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat) that can be leveraged to convert from UTC to the user's locale.

Whenever possible, present date and time according to the user's locale.

export const localeDate = new Date('2023-09-15T12:00:00.000Z');

export const localeFormat = {
  year: 'numeric',
  month: 'long',
  day: 'numeric',
  weekday: 'long',
};

| Locale | Date                                                            |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| en-US  | {Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', localeFormat).format(localeDate)} |
| en-AU  | {Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-AU', localeFormat).format(localeDate)} |
| de     | {Intl.DateTimeFormat('de', localeFormat).format(localeDate)}    |

### Timezones

In addition to formatting a date according to the user's locale, present time in the user's timezone and display the timezone alongside the time stamp for clarity.

In instances when a user's timezone cannot be determined, output the date and time in UTC+0.

<Notification
  status="info"
  message="The same moment in time will be presented differently based on the user's timezone and locale."
  width={{ max: 'large' }}
  margin={{ bottom: 'medium' }}
/>

<BestPracticeGroup>
  <Example
    height="none"
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message:
        'Utilize the browser locale to format and update the date and time for users, providing a personalized experience.',
    }}
  >
    <TimezoneExample />
  </Example>
  <Example
    height="none"
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don't present a date in a different timezone than that of the user. This leads to confusion, increased cognitive load, and sets users up for failure.`,
    }}
  >
    <TimezoneExample bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

### ISO 8601 Formatting

ISO 8601 is an internationally recognized standard for presenting date and time. It is presented as `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`. For example, `2023-02-07T06:57:00.000Z`.

Some use cases include:

- Log files
- Trigger times

Even though ISO 8601 is an internationalized standard, it is not the most friendly format for users. In most other cases, date and time formatting should be based on the user's [locale](#locale-formatting) and [timezone](#timezones).

## Relative time

Relative time stamps display:

1. How recently an event has occurred.
1. How far in the future an event will occur.

Relative time stamps remove the need for the user to perform mental calculations by presenting timestamps in written form like "2 days ago".

When displaying relative time:

- Adapt and show the appropriate unit of time. For example, after 60 minutes, display hours.
- Unless required, displaying the time for anything less than a second and more than a week is generally not needed.
- For older events, such as anything that happened more than a week ago, consider using [absolute time](#absolute-time) instead.
- Consider whether or not it's important for users to be able to see the absolute time as well. This could be placed within a tooltip or displayed on a detail page.

| Description            | Display                          | Display when space is limited   |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Within the last minute | Just now; a minute ago           | now; a min ago                  |
| 1 day ago              | yesterday                        | yesterday                       |
| < 1 week ago           | x days, hour, minute, second ago | x days, hr, min, sec ago        |
| >= 1 week ago          | [Absolute time](#absolute-time)  | [Absolute time](#absolute-time) |
| In 1 day               | tomorrow                         | tomorrow                        |
| < 1 week from now      | in x days, hour, minute, second  | in x days, hr, min sec          |
| In >= 1 week           | [Absolute time](#absolute-time)  | [Absolute time](#absolute-time) |

<BestPracticeGroup>
  <Example
    height="none"
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message:
        'Provide users with only relevant information. In this use case, users do not need to know how many seconds ago an activity was last performed or the exact time activities older than a month were performed.',
    }}
  >
    <RelativeTimeExample />
  </Example>
  <Example
    height="none"
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don't include additional information if it isn't needed. This will hurt readability and cause issues with layouts at smaller breakpoints.`,
    }}
  >
    <RelativeTimeExample bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

## Abbreviating date and time

When space in the UI is limited, units of time, days of the week, and months can be abbreviated.

Some contexts in which abbreviations may be needed are:

- Within cells of a data table
- At smaller breakpoints

| Units of time  | Abbreviation |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| millisecond(s) | ms           |
| second(s)      | sec          |
| minute(s)      | min          |
| hour(s)        | hr           |
| day(s)         | day, days    |
| week(s)        | wk           |
| month(s)       | mo           |
| year(s)        | yr           |

To abbreviate days of the week or months, use the [Javascript Intl.DateTimeFormat method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat). The general convention for English is to use the first 3 letters of the day or month name.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/date-and-time/AbbreviatedDateExample.js"
  horizontalLayout
  height="none"
>
  <AbbreviatedDateExample />
</Example>

## Zero-padding

When a user needs to compare time stamps such as in a list or column, zero-padding ensures units are uniform and aligned for easy readability and comparison. When applicable, a leading zero should be included within both the date and time.

Zero-padding is not needed when context contains only one time stamp, see [notification example](#notification).

<BestPracticeGroup>
  <Example
    height="none"
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message:
        'Zero-pad both date and timestamps for easier comparison across rows.',
    }}
  >
    <ZeroPaddingExample />
  </Example>
  <Example
    height="none"
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don't omit the leading zero for the date or time. This causes issues with alignment and layout which prevents users from being able to quickly scan and compare the information.`,
    }}
  >
    <ZeroPaddingExample bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

## Examples

### Notifications

When displaying future events such as upcoming updates, expiration dates, and ongoing processes:

- Use the friendlier, more conversational [relative time]() phrasing, such as “in x days”.
- Provide the date, exact time, and timezone alongside the relative time to remove any ambiguity.

<BestPracticeGroup columns={['auto']}>
  <Example
    height="none"
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message:
        'Accompany the relative time with the exact date, time, and timezone in which the event will occur.',
    }}
    width="100%"
  >
    <DateTimeNotificationExample />
  </Example>
  <Example
    height="none"
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Don’t omit write ambiguous messages that may lead users to question when exactly an event will occur. In this example, this message doesn’t tell the user whether or not their license would be expiring in the morning, during the day, or in the evening. `,
    }}
    width="100%"
  >
    <DateTimeNotificationExample bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>
