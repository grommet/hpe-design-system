To help enforce the World Wide Web's accessibility, policies and laws have been put in place which require certain standards to be met for all web, software and non-web documents.

As a designer or developer, we are morally responsible for creating accessible products, and it is necessary that we are aware of the mandated standards established across the world. The following links provide insight into how governments and policy makers have come to include accessibility into laws, emphasizing the importance of making the web inclusive for all. In general, it is helpful to understand some of these policies and how they may affect your work product.
