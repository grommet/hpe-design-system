Typography is about more than words. It is an integral part of brand personality and design. When making a statement, the visual language should be clear, recognizable, and easy to understand. For specific token values and implementation details, see the [Typography system](/design-tokens/typography-system).
## HPE Graphik styles

The weights and styles shown are part of the HPE Design System theme. HPE Graphik comes in a variety of weights. For digital experiences we use Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold and Bold weights at a variety of scales to compliment the content in a given design.

### Best practices for headings

For accessibility, ensure each page follows proper HTML structure by applying [semantically correct heading levels](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements#Usage_notes) and using the appropriate heading element for every section.

Heading levels create a scaffold of a web page's content structure by defining the main page title, page sections, and subsections of those sections.

Correctly implementing heading levels:

- establishes a more scannable visual hierarchy
- creates a clear HTML structure which is critical for use by assistive technologies

If heading levels are not implemented in the correct hierarchy, users of screen readers and other assistive technologies will have a more effortful and difficult experience using the application.
Headings beyond level 3 are rarely needed and often signal overly dense content. Before introducing levels 4–6, review whether the information can be simplified or reorganized into clearer sections.

<BestPracticeGroup>
  <Example
    height="none"
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message:
        'Use the correct semantic heading element. Apply a heading token to achieve the desired visual style. Notice "heading-medium" applied to the h2 card title and h3 card title.',
    }}
    width="100%"
  >
    <SyntaxHighlighterWrapper tabIndex="0" wrapLongLines language="javascript">
      {`<h1 class="heading-xlarge">Page title</h1>
<h2 class="card heading-medium">Card title</h2>
<h2 class="heading-large">Section title</h2>
<h3 class="card heading-medium">Another card title</h3>`}
    </SyntaxHighlighterWrapper>
  </Example>
  <Example
    height="none"
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Change the semantic level of a heading to adjust the visual styling. This can lead to accessibility issues and break the semantic structure of the page. Notice the incorrect jump from h1 to h3.`,
    }}
  >
    <SyntaxHighlighterWrapper tabIndex="0" wrapLongLines language="javascript">
      {`<h1 class="heading-xlarge">Page title</h1>
<h3 class="card heading-medium">Card title</h2>
<h2 class="heading-large">Section title</h2>
<h3 class="card heading-medium">Another card title</h3>`}
    </SyntaxHighlighterWrapper>
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

### Styling exceptions

Some components may require visual consistency regardless of heading level. For example, card titles in dashboard layouts often need to share the same text size even if their semantic levels differ. In these cases, keep the correct semantic heading level, but apply the appropriate [token to style the text](/design-tokens/typography-system#text).

### Heading levels in practice

Use `level={1}` for the single `<h1>` on the page. Follow with `level={2}` for main sections and `level={3}` for subsections. See the example below for a recommended structure.

It is uncommon to use a heading level higher than 3, as this often indicates that the page content is very dense. Before implementing heading levels 4–6, consider whether the information can be presented more concisely or divided into additional sections.

- For Card specific guidance, see [card titles](/components/card#card-titles) documentation.
- For Layer specific guidance, see [layer titles](/components/layer#layer-titles) documentation.

Below is a Grommet example showing proper heading levels for a page with three topics, each with two subtopics.

```
<Heading level={1}>Page title</Heading>

  <Heading level={2}>Topic A</Heading>
    <Heading level={3}>Subtopic 1a</Heading>
    <Heading level={3}>Subtopic 2a</Heading>

  <Heading level={2}>Topic B</Heading>
    <Heading level={3}>Subtopic 1b</Heading>
    <Heading level={3}>Subtopic 2b</Heading>

  <Heading level={2}>Topic C</Heading>
    <Heading level={3}>Subtopic 1c</Heading>
    <Heading level={3}>Subtopic 2c</Heading>

```

## Paragraph

Paragraphs represent blocks of flowing text and are styled using [Text design tokens](/design-tokens/typography-system#text) for font size, weight, and line height. To ensure optimal readability, Paragraphs differ from standard text by enforcing a maximum width to limit line length. Implementations should reference the corresponding Text t-shirt size tokens for typography properties and apply the associated `maxWidth` value to the container.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/typography/ParagraphExample.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/paragraph?theme=hpe#props"
>
  <ParagraphExample />
</Example>

## Text

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/typography/TextSizeExample.js"
  docs="https://v2.grommet.io/text?theme=hpe#props"
>
  <TextSizeExample />
</Example>

### Text best practices

Use the t-shirt size `maxWidth` design token on paragraphs to limit the width of text to ensure readability.

While each text t-shirt sizes comes with a default font weight, the emphasis of text can be adjusted to suit the context by using the [fontWeight](/design-tokens/global#fontweight) design tokens.

## Responsiveness

The values of heading tokens automatically step down one t-shirt size at the `small` [breakpoint](/design-tokens/global#breakpoint). This ensures content scales appropriately as the screen size decreases.

When utilizing the CSS files, a media query is included in the "dimension.small.css" file to adjust the token values at the `small` breakpoint.

## Accessibility

[Typography desgin tokens](/design-tokens/typography-system) use `rem` units to scale fonts according to a user's browser settings.

## Font delivery

In most cases, teams should point to the web-hosted version of the HPE Graphik fonts to ensure users always have the latest version.

For Grommet-based teams, these CDN URLs are already included in grommet-theme-hpe.

For non-Grommet teams, the appropriate CDN URLs and font-face definitions can be found in [grommet-theme-hpe](https://github.com/grommet/grommet-theme-hpe/blob/master/src/js/themes/hpe.js) by searching for `@font-face`.

### Fonts for offline usage

In rare cases where a product needs to reference the HPE Graphik fonts but users don't have internet access from their browser or maybe a designer needs the fonts locally, you can download the fonts for local use.

HPE Graphik fonts can be downloaded from Brand Central in [OTF/Vector and Web](https://brandcentral.hpe.com/brand-central/content/typography) formats.
