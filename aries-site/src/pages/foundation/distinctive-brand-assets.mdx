## Flexible ingredients

### Color and texture styles

Gradient, datawave, and light/shadow assets can be consumed directly from the HPE theme.

These assets may be seen commonly throughout marketing contexts and should be used more
sparingly within platform. However, there are appropriate use cases such as or a page header
for a service catalog or [call to action cards](/components/card/call-to-action-card), where
the incorporation of bolder, vibrant elements communicate "unlocking value" and can inspire
and entice the user.

See [HPE theme backgrounds](https://github.com/grommet/grommet-theme-hpe/blob/master/src/js/themes/backgrounds.js)
for a full list of background values.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/distinctive-brand-assets/ColorAndTexture.js"
  horizontalLayout
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
>
  <ColorAndTexture />
</Example>

### Typography styles

Texture or gradient in type can easily be implemented using [Box](/components/box)'s `background`
plus [Heading](/foundation/typography#heading) or [Text](/foundation/typography#text).

For rules such as "only place texture or gradient filled text on white backgrounds" and other
advice, please refer to [HPE Brand Central](https://brandcentral.hpe.com/brand-central/content/distinctive-brand-assets).

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/distinctive-brand-assets/TypographyStyles.js"
  horizontalLayout
  width={{ min: 'medium' }}
>
  <TypographyStyles />
</Example>
