[Bill speaking] Hello, my name is Bill Tipton and I work for Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a Product Accessibility Champion. As part of my responsibilities, I educate and advise our product designers, developers, and decision-makers on accessible user experiences.

Unfortunately in May of 1999, I suddenly went completely blind. Since then, I have used a screen reader daily to access the internet and other digital technologies. I often experience what it is like to attempt to use software with many accessibility and usability issues. It is not a pleasant feeling or experience when you are excluded from accessing a product due to technical issues that could have easily been avoided if somebody took the time to incorporate accessibility early in the design or development process.

Although I am a member of the disabled community, I cannot speak for all people with disabilities. However, I personally would like the chance to be able to use all digital technologies including software effectively, so I am able to participate equally in all of life's digital opportunities.

Through direct engagements, live demonstrations, and usability evaluations, I highlight the requirements, design standards, and value to our business success by supporting a diverse set of user personas, including our valued customers with disabilities. I encourage all researchers, product designers, developers, product managers, and others to incorporate accessibility and usability to create more accessible products and experiences.

In life and in our work, it is important to continuously advocate for inclusive environments for all, including becoming an ally for our disabled community. Thank you, and now let's go out and create some positive change.
