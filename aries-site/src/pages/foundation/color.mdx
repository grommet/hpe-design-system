## Applying color

HPE colors are stored in the form of design tokens. Rather than applying RGB or hex values, use semantic colors (otherwise called [semantic tokens](/design-tokens/overview#semantic-tokens)). Semantic color names describe when and where to apply them.

Applying semantic colors as intended ensures your design:

- Is aligned with the current theme and visual direction.
- Is accessible.
- Enables theme mode switching (light and dark. See [Theming]()).
- Improves maintenance (when themes are updated, designs are synchronised with token updates. See [design tokens overview](/design-tokens/overview).)

You will notice that the HPE Design System Color guidance is
different from Brand Central. Prioritize the below HPE Design
System color palette over Brand Central when identifying colors
for your app or web based experience.

## Color palettes

Color is a key way we express our brand. Using color on
interface elements, how typography is presented, displaying data
visualizations, and adjusting context of the experience to light
and dark are just some of the ways we illustrate inclusive
design for our app and web based experiences.

### Brand color

HPE green symbolizes growth and vitality, commands attention and
inspires action. Our green is an essential part of our brand
identity and should be evident in every communication wherever
possible. Always use the `decorative.brand` token to maintain consistency across channels and media.

{/* <BrandColor /> */}

### Backgrounds
Background colors establish depth, hierarchy, and interaction feedback across surfaces.
Our color palette is only impactful when used in the correct
context. Accommodating both light and dark modes of a user
experience with the appropriate color palette creates a
successful customer experience.

For more direction on how to use background colors within your
layout, see [background colors guidance](/foundation/background-colors-guidance).

- Start layouts with `color.background.back`; layer content surfaces with front and floating for elevation.
- Include contrast background to separate dense regions; prefer contrast over borders in tight layouts.
- Limit strong or xstrong variants to focal areas; pair with onStrong text and icon tokens for legibility.
- Use selected background tokens for selection instead of ad‑hoc highlight.

#### Overlay

Overlay color dims inactive content to direct attention to an active layer.

- Apply overlay behind modal, drawer, or dialog surfaces to reduce cognitive load.
- Limit overlay opacity to preserve context; avoid fully obscuring underlying layout.
- Prevent custom overlay hacks; use the theme-provided overlay color for consistency.

### Borders
Border colors delineate interactive areas and reinforce state when spacing alone is insufficient. Borders help differentiate elements and input fields from surrounding content. In light and dark modes the chosen strength should match density and emphasis; in many cases a border can be omitted when spacing or contrast already performs the job.

- Use the default border token for neutral boundaries and dividers.
- Apply selected border only when selection is not already clear from fill.
- Add status borders sparingly to reinforce (not replace) text or icon messaging.
- Omit borders where spacing or contrast background already separates content.


### Text
Text colors govern prominence and readability while signaling interaction or status.

- Use default text for body copy; prefer strong only for headings and key figures.
- Apply weak for supporting or secondary metadata; avoid weak on actionable labels.
- Use primary text for interactive anchors; pair with its hover state for clarity.
- Invert text on strong or selected backgrounds using the appropriate on* variant.
- Use critical text for error messaging; pair with an icon for faster recognition.

### Icon
Icon colors mirror text hierarchy and must remain legible at small sizes.

- Default to the standard icon color for regular interface glyphs.
- Align icon severity with text severity (critical, warning, etc.) for multi‑channel signaling.
- Invert icons on strong or selected backgrounds using on* variants.
- Avoid decorative colors on functional icons; reserve decorative palette for illustration.

### Decorative
Decorative colors provide brand and accent without conveying status or interaction.

- Use `decorative.brand` for brand anchors and signature accents.
- Limit secondary decorative hues to illustration and non‑interactive ornamentation.
- Avoid substituting decorative colors for status; use semantic text or foreground status tokens instead.

### Data visualization (Dataviz)
Dataviz colors differentiate categories and encode status without overwhelming perception.

- Begin categorical series with the first token and proceed sequentially.
- Limit visible category count; consider grouping beyond eight series.
- Ensure label contrast using default or strong text.
- Reserve status colors for threshold or state indicators; avoid for neutral series.
- Use series colors in a consistent left‑to‑right order for comparability across views.
- Consider consolidating very low-variance series into a single aggregate color; instead, use drill-down for detail.
- When using Grommet DataChart, series colors are applied automatically in sequence to support consistent interpretation.

### Focus
Focus colors ensure clear keyboard and assistive navigation cues.

- Render focus with outer ring plus support ring for clarity.
- Never remove focus; adjust thickness or radius if necessary.
- Limit glow effects that reduce crisp edge contrast.

### Foreground
Foreground colors fill graphic and quantitative regions (meters, progress, indicators) with semantic meaning.

### Status colors
Status colors reinforce state and feedback (error, warning, success, informational, unknown) across surfaces, text, icons, and data regions.

- Use status color only when conveying state; avoid decorative substitution.
- Pair status color with an icon or concise label for rapid scanning.
- Limit multiple simultaneous status colors in a single dense region.

- Use primary foreground for neutral or brand‑aligned progress.
- Apply status foregrounds (critical, warning, unknown) only when encoding state; pair with text or icon.
- Limit multiple status colors in one component; segment or use tooltips for complex breakdowns.
- Avoid decorative fills for status; prefer semantic foreground set.

## Color accessibility

Color accessibility ensures all users can perceive and understand content regardless of visual ability. HPE Design System prioritizes accessibility compliance through semantic color tokens.

### Contrast requirements

Always meet WCAG 2.1 contrast standards for text and interactive elements:

- Maintain a minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text
- Maintain a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio for large text (18px and above or 14px bold)
- Ensure interactive elements meet a 3:1 contrast ratio against adjacent colors

Semantic color tokens are designed to meet these requirements when applied as intended.

### Color pairing

Pair text and icon colors appropriately with background colors to maintain accessibility. Strong background colors require `onStrong` text and icon tokens.

For detailed color pairing guidance, see [color pairing](/design-tokens/color-pairing).

### Color as information

Never rely solely on color to convey information. Always provide additional visual cues such as:

- Text labels
- Icons
- Patterns or textures
- Underlines for links
