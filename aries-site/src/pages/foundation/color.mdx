## Applying color

HPE colors are stored in the form of design tokens. Rather than applying RGB or hex values, use semantic colors (otherwise called [semantic tokens](/design-tokens/overview#semantic-tokens)). Semantic color names describe when and where to apply them.

Applying semantic colors as intended ensures your design:

- Is aligned with the current theme and visual direction.
- Is accessible.
- Enables theme mode switching (light and dark. See [Theming]()).
- Improves maintenance (when themes are updated, designs are synchronised with token updates. See [design tokens overview](/design-tokens/overview).)

You will notice that the HPE Design System Color guidance is
different from Brand Central. Prioritize the below HPE Design
System color palette over Brand Central when identifying colors
for your app or web based experience.

## Color palettes

Color is a key way we express our brand. Using color on
interface elements, how typography is presented, displaying data
visualizations, and adjusting context of the experience to light
and dark are just some of the ways we illustrate inclusive
design for our app and web based experiences.

### Brand color

HPE green symbolizes growth and vitality, commands attention and
inspires action. Our green is an essential part of our brand
identity and should be evident in every communication wherever
possible. Always use the `decorative.brand` token to maintain consistency across channels and media.

{/* <BrandColor /> */}

## Color accessibility

Color accessibility ensures all users can perceive and understand content regardless of visual ability. HPE Design System prioritizes accessibility compliance through semantic color tokens.

### Contrast requirements

Always meet WCAG 2.1 contrast standards for text and interactive elements:

- Maintain a minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text
- Maintain a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio for large text (18px and above or 14px bold)
- Ensure interactive elements meet a 3:1 contrast ratio against adjacent colors

Semantic color tokens are designed to meet these requirements when applied as intended.

### Color pairing

Pair text and icon colors appropriately with background colors to maintain accessibility. Strong background colors require `onStrong` text and icon tokens.

For detailed color pairing guidance, see [color pairing](/design-tokens/color-pairing).

### Color as information

Never rely solely on color to convey information. Always provide additional visual cues such as:

- Text labels
- Icons
- Patterns or textures
- Underlines for links

## Background colors

Our color palette is only impactful when used in the correct
context. Accommodating both light and dark modes of a user
experience with the appropriate color palette creates a
successful customer experience.

For more direction on how to use background colors within your
layout, see [background colors guidance](/foundation/background-colors-guidance).

### Background palette

In light and dark modes, building depth with interface elements,
and the background is key in making readability or text and key
interactions key to driving users' success. The swatches below
illustrate how to use color for your experiences.

{/* <BackgroundLight />
<br />
<BackgroundDark /> */}

### Contrast

For times when you have more than two layers of content (e.g. a
background and a styled UI element on top of it), you can use
contrast to help add more layers of depth to your design,
illustrate a visual separation, or show how stacked interface
elements will look. By default, contrast will bump your
background to a lighter or darker tint based on the theme and
background.

{/* <ContrastLight />
<br />
<ContrastDark /> */}

## Border colors

Using border colors properly ensures that the user is able to
identify the state of various components. Borders help
differentiate elements and input fields from surrounding
content.

### Border palette

In light and dark modes, border is key in making separating
input fields or layout elements from surrounding content.
Depending on the context, a varying amount of strength is needed
for the border to be effective, and in many cases there may be
no border necessary.

{/* <BordersLight />
<br />
<BordersDark /> */}

## Text Colors

Text needs to be legible in all contexts. Ensuring high contrast
is met for accessibility and readability is important to
delivering users a consistent reading experience throughout HPE.

### Text color palette

Text colors have two states when working on different background
contexts; depending on background the text can invert to
accomodate a dark mode. To ensure text maintains readability, we
avoid color use with the exception of call to actions such as
hyperlinks and anchors.

{/* <TextLight />
<br />
<TextDark /> */}

## Status colors

{/* <StatusLight />
<br />
<StatusDark /> */}

## Focus color

Focus is critical to accessibility. When a user is navigating
with keyboard, focus indicates which element on the page is
active. Do not remove focus outline in your application, as this
will compromise the accessibility of the application.

{/* <FocusColor /> */}

## Elevation

Elevation creates depth between a foreground and background
element. Depending on the desired contrast, varying strengths of
elevation can be used. Elevation is implemented by default on
certain elements such as
[Menu](/components/menu) and [Select](/components/select).

{/* <ElevationLight />
<br />
<ElevationDark /> */}

## Overlay color

When a [Layer](/components/layer) is
open, this overlay extends over the rest of the application
content. It creates a visual distinction between the active
foreground Layer and the inactive background content. This is
controlled by `layer.overlay.background` in the theme.

{/* <Overlay /> */}

## Graph colors

Graph colors should be applied in order, starting with `graph-0` <ColorSwatch background="graph-0" />.
This color order was selected to provide clear distinction
between adjacent data. When using Grommet DataChart, graph
colors will be applied in order by default.

{/* <GraphColorsLight />
<br />
<GraphColorsDark /> */}
