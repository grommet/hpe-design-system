## Applying color

HPE colors are stored in the form of design tokens. Rather than applying RGB or hex values, use semantic colors (otherwise called [semantic tokens](/design-tokens/overview#semantic-tokens)). Semantic color names describe when and where to apply them.

Applying semantic colors as intended ensures your design:

- Is aligned with the current theme and visual direction.
- Is accessible.
- Enables theme mode switching (light and dark).
- Improves maintenance (when themes are updated, designs are synchronised with token updates. See [design tokens overview](/design-tokens/overview).)

The HPE Design System color palette and guidance differ from Brand Central. Prioritize the HPE Design System palette when selecting colors for app or web experiences.

## Color palettes

Color expresses brand, guides interaction, and supports accessibility. It shapes interface elements, typographic emphasis, data visualization clarity, and adaptation between light and dark modes. Applied intentionally, it reinforces inclusive design across HPE applications and web experiences.


### Backgrounds
Background colors establish depth, hierarchy, and cognitive grouping. Products typically begin with `color.background.back` as the base, then layer surfaces using `color.background.front` and `color.background.floating` to convey elevation. Use contrast background tokens to separate dense regions, preferring contrast backgrounds over borders in tight layouts to reduce visual noise.

For more direction on how to use background colors, see [background colors guidance](/foundation/background-colors-guidance).

#### Overlay

Overlay color dims inactive content to direct attention to an active layer; apply it behind modal, drawer, or dialog surfaces to reduce cognitive load using `color.background.overlay`.

### Borders
Border colors delineate areas only when spacing or background contrast are insufficient. Use `color.border.default` for neutral boundaries and dividers, and omit borders where existing spacing or contrast already provides clear separation.

### Text
Text colors help create hierarchy and ensure readability. Use `color.text.default` for body copy and `color.text.heading` for headings. `color.text.strong` can be used to emphasize key figures or other important text. To de-emphasize content and create a clear visual hierarchy, apply `color.text.weak` to secondary information.

### Icon
Icon colors follow text hierarchy and must remain legible at small sizes. Match an icon's color emphasis with its accompanying text.

### Decorative
Decorative colors provide brand and accent without conveying status or interaction. Limit secondary decorative hues to illustration and non‑interactive ornamentation, and avoid substituting decorative colors for status; use semantic text or foreground status tokens instead.

### Data visualization
Dataviz colors differentiate categories without overwhelming perception.

- Begin categorical series with the first token and proceed sequentially.
- Use series colors in a consistent left‑to‑right order for comparability across views.
- Consider consolidating very low-variance series into a single aggregate color; instead, use drill-down for detail.
- When using Grommet DataChart, series colors are applied automatically in sequence to support consistent interpretation.

### Foreground
Foreground colors fill graphic and quantitative regions (meters, progress, indicators) with semantic meaning.

### Status colors
Status colors reinforce state and feedback (critical, warning, ok, informational, unknown) across surfaces, text and icons.

- Use status color only when conveying semantic meaning; avoid decorative substitution.
- Pair status color with an icon or concise label for rapid scanning.

### Focus
Focus provide clear visual cues for keyboard and assistive technology navigation by highlighting the currently active element, reinforcing accessible interaction.

## Color accessibility

Color accessibility ensures all users can perceive and understand content regardless of visual ability. HPE Design System prioritizes accessibility compliance through semantic color tokens.

### Color pairing

Pair text and icon colors appropriately with background colors to maintain accessibility. Strong background colors require `onStrong` text and icon tokens.

For detailed color pairing guidance, see [color pairing](/design-tokens/color-pairing).

### Color as information

Never rely solely on color to convey information. Always provide additional visual cues such as:

- Text labels
- Icons
- Patterns or textures
- Underlines for links
