## Color Palettes

Color is a key way we express our brand. Using color on
interface elements, how typography is presented, displaying data
visualizations, and adjusting context of the experience to light
and dark are just some of the ways we illustrate inclusive
design for our app and web based experiences.

### Brand Color
            
HPE green symbolizes growth and vitality, commands attention and
inspires action. Our green is an essential part of our brand
identity and should be evident in every communication wherever
possible. Always use the custom color specifications seen here
to maintain consistency across channels and media.

### Core Palette

HPE Core colors provide a set of swatches that compliment HPE
Green and help establish the vibrant experience HPE embraces. We
use "emphasis" as a way to show the importance and use the most
vibrant hue on light or dark contexts. To maintain accessibility
requirements, it's important to be mindful of how the aspects of
the color library are used in conjunction with the Core colors.

### Light Palette
              
The light color palette provides a set of swatches which
compliment HPE Core colors for use in combination with dark text
to maintain color accessibility in your experience. Use these
colors only when implementing a light theme.

### Dark Palette

The dark color palette provides a set of swatches which
compliment HPE Core colors for use in combination with light
text to maintain color accessibility in your experience. Use
