The overall design philosophy is to distinguish content sections with the strategic use of color
and avoid the use of excessive borders. This helps reduce visual clutter which a reader's eye
and brain must sift through.

The application of background colors creates a visual hierarchy supporting the information
hierarchy for the page. When applying background colors to content or layout, it is helpful
to think about the content's role and relation to the page's information hierarchy.

## Basic or Layered approach?

There are two approaches to how background colors should be used: [Basic](#basic) or [Layered](#layered). For consistency across an application, a single approach should be used app-wide. 

The decision to use the Basic or Layered approach comes down to how much visual differentiation is desired between background and foreground elements.

- If a more subtle distinction is desired, use the [Basic](#basic) layout.
- If a more defined contrast is desired, such as what is used for this Design System website, use the [Layered](#layered) layout.

A single approach should be used app-wide. You should not use the layered approach on some pages of an application and the basic approach on others. 

Explore detailed guidance for applying each approach below.

## Basic

In this approach, background color is oriented to keep the overall user interface focused and
clutter-free. The background color is held consistent throughout the page and content section
separation is accomplished primarily through the use of typography and spacing (via margins
and padding).

- **background** <ColorSwatch background="background" /> - The default background color when no other background color is specified.
- **background-contrast** <ColorSwatch background="background-contrast" /> - Used to indicate secondary content.

Refer to the [background palette](/foundation/color#background-palette) for definition
of each background color namespace and value.

### Basic layout with Cards

`background` <ColorSwatch background="background" /> should be used for the application background as well as foreground elements, like Cards.

The header, main content, and cards all use `background` <ColorSwatch background="background" /> for the background color.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/background-colors/BasicLayoutCardsExample.js"
  width="100%"
  showResponsiveControls={['laptop', 'mobile']}
  screenContainer
>
  <BasicLayoutCardsExample />
</Example>

### Basic layout with supporting content

In this example, the header and main content use `background` <ColorSwatch background="background" /> and the help text uses `background-contrast` <ColorSwatch background="background-contrast" />. Usage of `background-contrast` and supplemental regions like this should be kept to a minimum.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/background-colors/BasicLayoutExample.js"
  width="100%"
  showResponsiveControls={['laptop', 'mobile']}
  screenContainer
>
  <BasicLayoutExample />
</Example>

## Layered

The layered approach to background color is oriented towards more complex content situations. In addition to typography and spacing, background colors are used to create separate content sections and promote focus on primary content.

In this approach, the overall background color should be `background-back` and specific content sections which should be the primary focus of attention should use <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>`background-front`</span>.

From an information architecture, as well as from a component layout
perspective, `background-back` should not be used within a context which
already has <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>`background-front`</span>.
For instance, a primary navigation header should not use <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>`background-front`</span>
above a main content section that uses `background-back`.

- **background-back** <ColorSwatch background="background-back" /> - The overall background color.
- **background-front** <ColorSwatch background="background-front" /> - The background color for content which should be the primary focus.
- **background-contrast** <ColorSwatch background="background-contrast" /> - Could be used to indicate a secondary content area within a large content section.

Refer to the [background palette](/foundation/color#background-palette) for definition
of each background color namespace and value.

## Examples of Layered Layout

For example, a page with a [header](/components/header), summary content, and a grid of
[cards](/components/card) would use `background-front` for each card and
`background-back` for everything else.

For a multi-column page layout, `background-front` could be used to distinguish the column which should be the primary focus.

### With fixed header

When the header is fixed, use `background-front` <ColorSwatch background="background-front" /> for the header since it is layered in front of the main content.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/background-colors/LayeredLayoutFixedExample.js"
  width="100%"
  showResponsiveControls={['laptop', 'mobile']}
  screenContainer
>
  <LayeredLayoutFixedExample />
</Example>

### Header scrolls with content

When the header scrolls with the main content, use `background-back` <ColorSwatch background="background-back" /> for the header since it is flush with the main content. An example of this design would be the Design System website.

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/background-colors/LayeredLayoutExample.js"
  width="100%"
  showResponsiveControls={['laptop', 'mobile']}
  screenContainer
>
  <LayeredLayoutExample />
</Example>
