The overall design philosophy is to distinguish content sections with the strategic use of color
and avoid the use of excessive borders. This helps reduce visual clutter which a reader's eye
and brain must sift through.

The application of background colors creates a visual hierarchy supporting the information
hierarchy for the page. When applying background colors to content or layout, it is helpful
to think about the content's role and relation to the page's information hierarchy.

There are two approaches to how background colors should be used: [Basic](#basic) or [Layered](#layered). Explore guidance for applying each approach below.

## Basic

In this approach, background color is oriented to keep the overall user interface focused and
clutter-free. The background color is held consistent throughout the page and content section
separation is accomplished primarily through the use of typography and spacing (via margins
and padding).

In the basic approach, visual distinction for a header or an app-wide sidebar from the
page's primary background is created by applying a second color with significant contrast
to `background`. For instance, a dark blue, [persistent navigation sidebar](/templates/persistent-navigation) creates the desired contrast,
achieving visual separation of the sidebar from the primary content.

- **background** <ColorSwatch background="background" /> - The default background color when no other background color is specified.
- **background-contrast** <ColorSwatch background="background-contrast" /> - Used to indicate secondary content.
- **background (dark)** <ColorSwatch background={{color: 'background', dark: true}} /> or another color (dark) - Used to indicate a [primary navigation sidebar](/templates/persistent-navigation) or [header](/components/header).

Refer to the [background palette](/foundation/color#background-palette) for definition
of each background color namespace and value.

### Example of basic layout

<Example
  code="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/master/aries-site/src/examples/foundation/background-colors/BasicLayoutExample.js"
  width="100%"
  showResponsiveControls={['laptop', 'mobile']}
  screenContainer
>
  <BasicLayoutExample />
</Example>

## Layered

The layered approach to background color is oriented towards more complex content situations. In addition to typography and spacing, background colors are used to create separate content sections and promote focus on primary content.

In this approach, the overall background color should be `background-back` and specific content sections which should be the primary focus of attention should use <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>`background-front`</span>.

From an information architecture, as well as from a component layout
perspective, `background-back` should not be used within a context which
already has <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>`background-front`</span>.
For instance, a primary navigation header should not use <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>`background-front`</span>
above a main content section that uses `background-back`.

- **background-back** <ColorSwatch background="background-back" /> - The overall background color.
- **background-front** <ColorSwatch background="background-front" /> - The background color for content which should be the primary focus.
- **background-contrast** <ColorSwatch background="background-contrast" /> - Could be used to indicate a secondary content area within a large content section.
- **background (dark)** <ColorSwatch background={{color: "background", dark: true}} /> or another color (dark) - Could be used to indicate a primary navigation sidebar or header.

Refer to the [background palette](/foundation/color#background-palette) for definition
of each background color namespace and value.

### Example of layered layout

For example, a page with a [header](/components/header), summary content, and a grid of
[cards](/components/card) would use `background-front` for each card and
`background-back` for everything else.

For a multi-column page layout, `background-front` could be used to distinguish the column which should be the primary focus.
