The overall design philosophy is to distinguish content sections with the strategic use of color
and avoid the use of excessive borders. This helps reduce visual clutter which a reader's eye 
and brain must sift through.

The application of background colors creates a visual hierarchy supporting the information 
hierarchy for the page. When applying background colors to content or layout, it is helpful 
to think about the content's role and relation to the page's information hierarchy.
There are two approaches to how background colors should be used: [Basic](#basic) or [Layered](#layered). See guidance for each approach below.

## Basic

The basic approach to background color is oriented around keeping the overall user interface focused and un-cluttered. Separation of sections in the page is accomplished primarily via typography and spacing (via margins and padding).

An app-wide sidebar or header could be distinguished by another color with opposite darkness, for instance a dark blue persistent navigation sidebar. If there is a section of the page with secondary content, such as help text, background-contrast could be used.

- **background** - the default background color when no other background color is specified
- **background-contrast** - could be used to indicate secondary content
- **background (dark)** or another color (dark) - could be used to indicate a primary navigation sidebar or header

  width="100%"
  showResponsiveControls={['laptop', 'mobile']}
  screenContainer
>
  <BasicLayoutExample />
</Example>

## Layered

The layered approach to background color is oriented towards more complex content situations, using background colors to help separate content sections in addition to typography and margins.

In this approach, the overall background color should be `background-back` and specific content sections that should be the primary focus of attention should use `background-front`.

For example, a page with a header, some summary content, and then a grid of Cards would use `background-front` for each Card and then `background-back` for everything else.

For a multi-column page layout, `background-front` could be used to distinguish the column that should be more in focus.

From an information architecture as well as from a component layout perspective, `background-back` should not be used within a context that already has `background-front`. For instance, a primary navigation header should not use `background-front` above a main content section that uses `background-back`.

- **background-back** - the overall background color
- **background-front** - the background color of content that should be the primary focus
- **background-contrast** - could be used to indicate a secondary content area within a large content section
- **background (dark)** or another color (dark) - could be used to indicate a primary navigation sidebar or header
