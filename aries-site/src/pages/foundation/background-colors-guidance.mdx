The overall design philosophy is to distinguish content sections with the strategic use of color
and avoid the use of excessive borders. This helps reduce visual clutter which a reader's eye 
and brain must sift through.

The application of background colors creates a visual hierarchy supporting the information 
hierarchy for the page. When applying background colors to content or layout, it is helpful 
to think about the content's role and relation to the page's information hierarchy.
There are two approaches to how background colors should be used: [Basic](#basic) or [Layered](#layered). Explore guidance for applying each approach below.

## Basic

In this approach, background color is oriented to keep the overall user interface focused and 
clutter-free. The background color is held consistent throughout the page and content section 
separation is accomplished primarily through the use of typography and spacing (via margins 
and padding).

In the basic approach, visual distinction for a header or an app-wide sidebar from the 
page's primary background is created by applying a second color with significant contrast 
to `background`. For instance, a dark blue, [persistent navigation sidebar](/templates/persistent-navigation) creates the desired contrast, 
achieving visual separation of the sidebar from the primary content.

- **background** - The default background color when no other background color is specified.
- **background-contrast** - Used to indicate secondary content.
- **background (dark)** or another color (dark) - Used to indicate a [primary navigation sidebar](/templates/persistent-navigation) or [header](/components/header).

## Layered

The layered approach to background color is oriented towards more complex content situations, using background colors to help separate content sections in addition to typography and margins.

In this approach, the overall background color should be `background-back` and specific content sections that should be the primary focus of attention should use `background-front`.

For example, a page with a header, some summary content, and then a grid of Cards would use `background-front` for each Card and then `background-back` for everything else.

For a multi-column page layout, `background-front` could be used to distinguish the column that should be more in focus.

From an information architecture as well as from a component layout perspective, `background-back` should not be used within a context that already has `background-front`. For instance, a primary navigation header should not use `background-front` above a main content section that uses `background-back`.

- **background-back** - the overall background color
- **background-front** - the background color of content that should be the primary focus
- **background-contrast** - could be used to indicate a secondary content area within a large content section
- **background (dark)** or another color (dark) - could be used to indicate a primary navigation sidebar or header
