import { Checklist } from '../../components';

There are three levels of compliance in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) which reflect the priority of support:

1. **A: Essential**
   - If this is not met, assistive technologies will not be able to aid in reading, understanding or operating the page or product.
2. **AA: Ideal Support**
   - Required for multiple government and public websites. HPE strives for Level A and AA coverage on all products.
3. **AAA: Specialized Support**
   - Usually reserved for websites and applications that serve a specialized audience.

### Success Criteria

Each item on the checklist refers to a specific, testable success criterion within the WCAG 2.1 described by a reference number and title. Some accessibility issues align with multiple rules. In these cases, the most relevant criterion is identified for the checklist item.

### Does this checklist guarantee a product is fully accessible?

No. There is no such thing as a "100%" accessible product. However, this checklist prompts designers and developers to check for coverage of a wide range of disability conditions. Addressing these issues will improve experiences for all users who access your product and increase overall accessibility.

## Global Code

Global code affects an entire website or product application.
