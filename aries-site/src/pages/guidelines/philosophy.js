          Living generously requires understanding the needs of others. The HPE
          Design System is crafted upon user research and listening to customers
          first. We can then bring to bear the experiences that generously
          provide for the needs of people and their work. It requires a humility
          and position that is ready to serve others and continues to relentless
          pursue excellence in its craft for the sake of others.

          Partnering in community allows the HPE Design System to be built upon
          the energy and empowerment of collaboration. The community provides
          accountability, conversation and relationships that are the crucible
          for generating innovation. Community is the fuel for the fires of
          creativity and allows the Design System to expand and thrive. Best of
          all, it’s a great place to find support and celebrate success!
