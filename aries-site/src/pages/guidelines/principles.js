          Our principles provide clear criteria for the conception,
          craftsmanship and creativity our brand demands and our clients
          deserve. They are for designers and non-designers alike, anyone
          authoring or authorizing any form of design on behalf of HPE.

          We are a company reborn, a new culture, and in a new space. We live in
          markets that ravenous and cutthroat when we are respectful and humane.
          We need more than technology to drive us. We need to embrace the
          discomfort and push to look at all avenues to stoke the fire for the
          next generation of tools—We must explore!

          Presenting a long list of features or giving the user too much choice
          is not the business we’re in. Usefulness should be born out of a
          diverse library of solutions, each honed from relentless pursuit of
          solving the users needs—No, “One tool to rule them all!” mentality.
          Every interaction should ask if this is something essential? In the
          end, the purpose will be ascertained by the metrics.

          To ensure every experience we define is part of a cohesive direction,
          it is important to ask where this product lives in the ecosystem of
          HPE. Not all products have to look exact to garner the confidence of
          customers. It is important to check how it integrates and is consumed
          in conjunction with other services we provide.
