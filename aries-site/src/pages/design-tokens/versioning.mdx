## Migration

### Migrating from v1 to v2

v2-Landmark introduces significant updates to align with HPE's refreshed visual identity. This is a major version change reflecting a new brand expression and includes breaking changes.

A full list of changes and detailed instructions can be found in the [Migrating from hpe-design-tokens v1 to v2-Landmark guide](https://github.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/wiki/Migrating-from-hpe%E2%80%90design%E2%80%90tokens-v1-to-v2%E2%80%90Landmark) and the [grommet-theme-hpe v7 to v8 Migration Guide](https://github.com/grommet/grommet-theme-hpe/wiki/Migrating-from-HPE-Theme-7.x-to-8.x).

### Migrating from v0.9.0 to v1.0.0

v1 reflects styling of the updated HPE theme.

For `hpe-design-tokens`, there are no breaking API changes from v0.9.0 to v1.0.0, so teams  
may upgrade directly to v1.0.0 without code modifications. However, it is recommended to 
review the [changelog](https://github.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/releases/tag/hpe-design-tokens%401.0.0) 
to understand the token value changes.

For `grommet-theme-hpe`, there are breaking changes. To make the upgrade process smoother,
the complete migration has been divided into to two steps:
1. Upgrade from v5.x to v6.x ([grommet-theme-hpe v5 to v6 Migration Guide](https://github.com/grommet/grommet-theme-hpe/wiki/Migrating-from-HPE-Theme-5.x-to-6.x))
2. Upgrade from v6.x to v7.x ([grommet-theme-hpe v6 to v7 Migration Guide](https://github.com/grommet/grommet-theme-hpe/wiki/Migrating-from-HPE-Theme-6.x-to-7.x))


## Semantic versioning

HPE Design tokens follows the standards defined by semantic versioning with slight adaptations at the major version level to align with hpe-design-tokens as a style delivery mechanism.

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increments will occur when:

**1. MAJOR version** when there is a significant change to HPE’s brand expression and/or there are incompatible changes to the API.

Significant changes to the look and feel of HPE’s brand &mdash; even if no breaking changes to the namespace are made &mdash; will be signaled via a major change (i.e. the look and feel of the new major version is not compatible with the look and feel of the previous).

This signals that if service A is on v1.y.z and service B is on v2.y.z, there will be a mismatch in overall experience.

**2. MINOR version** when there is functionality added in a backward compatible manner. Examples include:

- Introducing a new token.
- Updating a token value in an expected, minor way. For example, slightly darkening or lightening a text color based on user testing/feedback.

**3. PATCH version** when backward compatible bug fixes are made. Examples include:

- Fixing a typo in a token value.
- Fixing a color value to meet accessibility requirements.
