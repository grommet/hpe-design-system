The proximity and grouping of elements establish a clear content hierarchy that facilitates a user in accomplishing their goals, free of distraction.

Layouts should be:

- **Responsive**: They should adapt to different screen sizes and device types.
- **Consistent**: They should maintain a predictable structure across the application.
- **Semantic**: They should be designed with HTML semantics in mind to ensure accessibility.

## Foundational scale

The following sizing scale has been built from the following principles:

- **Proportional**: Have a natural ratio where each step in the scale is proportional to other steps.
- **Composable**: Each scale step may is divisible into have, thirds, quarters, etc. Alternatively each step is composable from smaller steps.
- **Flexible**: Scale may be divided into subsets and provides choice serving a variety of use cases.

The sizing scale consists of a primary scale based on the doubling/halving of a 24px base unit and a supplementary scale doubling/halving a 16px base unit.

The resulting scale steps: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 192, 256, 384, 512, 768, 1024, 1536.

[Spacing](#spacing), [container](#container), [radius](#radius), and [borderWidth](#border-width) tokens are defined using subsets of this scale.

## Spacing

Spacing uses proximity principles to define relationships between content and create hierarchy within a page. Spacing design tokens define the padding within, margin around, or gap between content.

Spacing guides usersâ€™ eyes through the page, helping them understand the relationships between different elements. The HPE Design System minimizes use of borders to separate content. Instead spacing, typography, and background color are combined to create visual hierarchy

There are 12 spacing tokens to provide flexibility to cater to various design needs ranging from dense data-rich experiences to more spacious layouts.

### Spacing best practices

<BestPracticeGroup>
  <Example
    height="none"
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'do',
      message:
        'Use spacing design tokens to style compositional or layout components like cards, layers, and grid spacing.',
    }}
    width="100%"
  >
    <SpacingBestPractices />
  </Example>
  <Example
    height="none"
    bestPractice={{
      type: 'dont',
      message: `Use spacing design tokens to style element-level components. Instead use component-specific tokens or element tokens which will ensure correct sizing of elements across screen sizes.`,
    }}
  >
    <SpacingBestPractices bestPractice={false} />
  </Example>
</BestPracticeGroup>

## Containers

Containers define the minimum/maximum width or height for content areas.

Container tokens are particularly useful when defining grid layouts. In other cases, consider the approach of [content-driven layouts](/templates/content-layouts#content-driven-layouts) to avoid artificially constraining content.

There are 11 container tokens to provide flexibility to cater to various design needs.

  <DesignTokensTable active="semantic.container" />

## Radius

Radius tokens define the rounding of corners on elements. Radius can be used as a tool to further emphasize the shape or relationship between certain elements.

Larger elements, like page sections, may have a larger radius while elements nested within may have smaller radii.

## Border width

Border width tokens define the thickness of a border.

## Responsiveness

Layouts should be designed with responsiveness in mind to meet a user wherever they are &mdash; whether on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.

The values of semantic spacing and radius design tokens step down in size at the `small` [breakpoint](/design-tokens/global#breakpoint). This retains appropriate proportions between shape, spacing, and content as the screen size decreases.

When utilizing the CSS files, a media query is included in the `dimension.small.css` file to adjust the token values at the `small` breakpoint.

To further refine layouts for different screen sizes, various [breakpoints](/design-tokens/global#breakpoint) can be used to instruct logic for layout adjustments.
