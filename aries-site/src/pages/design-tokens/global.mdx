## fontStack

Font stack design tokens are a list of fonts that are used in the design system. The first font in the list is the primary font, and the rest are fallback fonts.

To learn more about options for how fonts can be loaded, read [font delivery documentation](/foundation/typography#font-delivery).

  <DesignTokensTable active="semantic.fontStack" />

## breakpoint

Breakpoint design tokens can be used for logic pertaining to layout adjustments as screen width changes. For example, a grid of cards may switch from a 3-column layout to a 2-column layout at the `medium` breakpoint.

<ContentPane>
  <DesignTokensTable active="semantic.breakpoint" />
</ContentPane>

### Built-in breakpoint changes

The values of semantic spacing and heading design tokens step down in size at the `small` breakpoint. These value shifts are built in to the system.

## fontWeight

Font weight design tokens are used to define the weight of text elements. Each [text size](/design-tokens/typography-system#text) has a default font weight, but this can be overridden by the `fontWeight` design tokens to add or remove emphasis based on the use case.

The system uses `bold` sparingly because it can hurt readability at smaller text sizes and instead relies on the `medium` font weight to create visual emphasis.

  <DesignTokensTable active="semantic.fontWeight" />
</ContentPane>

## focusIndicator

This design token is used to define a standardized focus indicator for interactive elements. The focus indicator is a visual cue that helps users understand where they are in the interface and what element is currently in focus.

This indicator should be used with the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class in CSS.

  <DesignTokensTable active="semantic.focusIndicator" />
