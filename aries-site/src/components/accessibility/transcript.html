<p>
    Hello, my name is Bill Tipton and I work for Hewlett Packard Enterprise
    as a Product Accessibility Champion. As part of my responsibilities,
    I educate and advise our product designers, developers, and 
    decision-makerson accessible user experiences.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately in May of 1999, I suddenly went completely blind.
    Since then, I have used a screen reader daily to access the internet 
    and other digital technologies. I often experience what it is like 
    to attempt to use software with many accessibility and usability issues.
    It is not a pleasant feeling or experience when you are excluded from 
    accessing a product due to technical issues that could have easily
    been avoided if somebody took the time to incorporate accessibility 
    early in the design or development process.
</p>

<p>
    Although I am a member of the disabled community, I cannot speak for 
    all people with disabilities. However, I personally would like the 
    chance to be able to use all digital technologies including software 
    effectively, so I am able to participate equally in all of life's 
    digital opportunities.
</p>

<p>
    Through direct engagements, live demonstrations, and usability 
    evaluations, I highlight the requirements, design standards, and value
    to our business success by supporting a diverse set of user personas,
    including our valued customers with disabilities. I encourage all 
    researchers, product designers, developers, product managers, 
    and others to incorporate accessibility and usability to create
    more accessible products and experiences.
</p>

<p>
    In life and in our work, it is important to continuously advocate for
    inclusive environments for all, including becoming an ally for our
    disabled community. Thank you, and now let's go out and create some 
    positive change.
</p>
