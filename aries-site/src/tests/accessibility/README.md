# Accessibility Testing

### What does this folder test?

This folder tests accessibility features such as aria features, color contrast, and any other rules supported by [axe](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.5). For keyboard accessibility tests, see the files in `tests/navigation/`.

We are using [axe-testcafe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-testcafe) to integrate these checks with TestCafe.
