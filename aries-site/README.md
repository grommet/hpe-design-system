### Editing "What's New" Page

The ["What's New" page](https://design-system.hpe.design/whats-new) acts as a journal for which Design System stakeholders may 
keep informed with the latest enhancements to the HPE Design System.

Contributors to the HPE Design System should share their contributions with 
community members and stakeholders by adding:
- A brief note about the contribution
- Hyperlinks to relevant content or GitHub issues

The "What's New" page can be found at [src/pages/whats-new.mdx](https://github.com/grommet/hpe-design-system/blob/feat-1335/aries-site/src/pages/whats-new.mdx).
- The file may be edited directly in GitHub.
- Content may be added / modified within the file by using [basic Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
